{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-\"that's what heroes do\". The \"Revengers\" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), \"his friend from work\", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun."]},

Chris Hemsworth (Thor) demanded the next film be more comedic and his character funnier, like Guardians of the Galaxy, and it shows on Ragnarok. There are plenty of jokes and running gags, but thankfully not too many as to drag the film down in parody (unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy films). Seriously the film is a joy to watch. A couple of laughs never hurt anybody.", "The action scenes are amazing and beautifully executed. From the gladiatorial fight between Thor and Hulk, to the fight against Hela and her army of the dead, to the air fight on Sakaar. Special effects abound, and we even see Thor finally mastering his power as the God of Thunder, after his Mjolnir hammer was destroyed.", "The story is complex but still quite predictable. The movie's plot is a mix of the Ragnarok myth (the Viking equivalent of the End of the World), the \"Planet Hulk\" comic book storyline, and a new enemy, the Goddess of Death Hela, who escapes from her prison and is hell bent on revenge against the House of Odin. After a series of events Thor ends up on the planet Sakaar which is ruled by the Grandmaster who organises gladiatorial fights for his pleasure. Thor has to fight against Hulk to gain his freedom. They both escape from the planet along with Valkyrie and Loki to save Asgard (and the Universe) from Hela's army.", "But the film's story features plot holes and logic inconsistencies, like, isn't Ragnarok too convenient to take advantage of while at the same time Hela happens to be on Asgard, raising hell (literally)? Still it's a fun movie to watch but I think Thor Ragnarok adds nothing new to the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe (for example there is no new Infinity Stone found) other than introduce the Valkyrie (possibly a love interest for Thor in the future films), the Grandmaster and a couple minor characters. Hela could have been a major enemy of the Avengers but she is no more apparently (you never know whether Marvel bring her back somehow, after all she's the Goddess of Death).", "All in all, I definitely enjoyed Thor Ragnarok even if it's not perfect. Go and see it, it's great."]},
{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["I think it's fair to say that, of all the franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the \"Thor\" franchise, to put it short, is passable. While 'Thor' (2011) was a better-than-your-average introduction to the God of Thunder, many did feel that it didn't spend enough time showing him as such, instead they had to make him human in order for us to get to know him. I liked the spectacle, the emotion and the effort for it... it was an entertaining film, but nothing special. 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013) did have bigger action sequences, and more funny chemistry between the brothers Thor and Loki, but the comedy and final act dragged it down, and became forgettable and uninspired, but I still had some fun with it. So, it's easy to understand that with the third movie about the mighty God of Thunder, Marvel needed this one to be good. And, luckily, with director Taika Waititi ('What We Do in the Shadows'), it seems this franchise has been brought some life. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is easily the best chapter in this saga. It's vibrant, entertaining, action-packed, sometimes dark, and, to many's surprise, very funny. I know the word \"funny\" is odd, since the story of \"Ragnarok\" is meant to be dark and apocalyptic, but the humor does hit when it needs to. We see that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been imprisoned, still searching for those Infinity Stones, but as he returns to Asgard, he discovers that his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the God of Mischief, has been ruling the kingdom and Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is nowhere to be seen. They discover that Asgard is in danger when they meet Hela (Cate Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, and sister of Thor and Loki (wasn't she supposed to be Loki's daughter? Then again, Ego was never meant to be Peter Quill's father...), who wants to rule Asgard and banish those who wrong her. Thor ends up on Sakaar where he meets Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), and he is told that he must fight in the arena in order to get to where he needs. His opponent happens to be the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), which is seen as not much of a challenge for him. Thor tries to reason with the Hulk and manages to persuade him to help fight Hela before all of Asgard is in ruins. What makes this movie work is that it seems Chris Hemsworth has more fun in the role of Thor than in previous films. Thor has always been seen as the more \"boring\" Avenger simply because he is an all powerful god who holds a hammer. There's nothing more about him to make him sympathetic, only when he is rid of those powers, does he become interesting. Taika Waititi has a unique vision on the characters of Thor and the Hulk, they really get a chance to shine in this movie than previous ones. They are more interesting here, than before. Plus, the comedy is used effectively. Unlike in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' (2017) where the humor stretches beyond the first act, and the characters joke, even when they're in danger... here, Waititi only uses the humor when its needed. During the final battle, no spoilers, there is little-to-no joking around, especially when the whole world could end. Plus, the replacing of Kat Dennings with the charismatic Jeff Goldblum is also inspired... he is great as the Grandmaster, and I cannot wait to see more of him, if Marvel decides to put him in more upcoming films. Overall, this is a fantastic \"Thor\" movie, and it works because it ticks the boxes that the other two films forgot to tick. Hemsworth really shines as the God of Thunder, and the supporting cast all do a terrific job in their respective roles. It's funny... but not too funny. It's a blast."]},

Not by how the story was structured,but because they somehow managed to transform the dark and gritty source material of the comics into a flat-out comedy in the best way possible. What they tried to accomplish in 2h 10m really gave me a huge smile on my face. Oh,and also because we're talking about Thor,which movie-wise,was kind of decent as a franchise (quite frankly). Don't get me wrong,i loved it,but there are some problems with the story. If you already saw The LEGO Movie,well,get ready,because there are so many jokes in this movie that at some point you won't even remember that you smiled. Another problem is Hela. While being excellently played by Cate Blanchett,i was almost going to call her Mrs. Exposition,given the fact that in some scenes it'll be just like The Mummy (2017),where you'll see stuff that sets-up something for another movie.", "The humor,as i said,was really great all around,and there wasn't a moment where i rolled my eyes or got bored with it. It was some solid humor all along. When the action kicked in,i was amazed by how those were choreographed actor-wise and created effects-wise. You even get to hear The Immigrant Song,which was used in the trailers as part of the \"Hype Engine\".", "And it was satisfying to see some actors (like Chris Hensworth and Mark Ruffalo) actually breath some fresh air (not the serious fresh air of the comics).", "So in the end,if you wanted to see a comedy that is really good and not The House or Rough Night,then this is the right movie. Thor Ragnarok deftly pays off itself with a great (mind-blowing for me) story,some funny hints at humor and some of the (not really) best action scenes of the year.

This really makes the movie a very enjoyable watch and some great moments.", "The plot is relatively simple in the fact that because of Loki taking over Asgard it has resulted in Hela a new threat trying to take over Asgard. Thor is sent to the other side of the universe and now has to rush back to Asgard to prevent Ragnarok. While many synopsis of the plot and even the title itself makes it seem like the stakes are really high. However, in the film it never really does amount to anything and watching it you don't feel like there is really any stakes at all. This is especially because of the fact that this movie is much more comedic and can be a bit jarring. You could go from Hela murdering people to a fun moment with Thor and it makes the plot not seem that important. The characters are great and fun to watch. Thor now has a much more lively personality compared to previous entries and there are some moments where we see more of his character. Still only \"some\" which is really weird considering the fact that his home is about to be destroyed and he isn't as panic as we think he should be. Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and while this movie does feel like more of Chris's personality than Thor it still feels natural and gives a much more fun movie to watch. Loki returns and is treated much more of a joke in this movie which leads to some great laughs but you remember that he was the threat that led to the Avengers to Assemble in the first place. Still he does have a pretty interesting character arc in this story and it works quite well with Tom Hiddleston still being an amazing Loki even for the laughs. Hela is the villain of this movie played by Cate Blancett and is the first true female MCU villain. Sadly, just like most MCU movie villains she is rather forgettable and underused. She only has one really cool scene and then is just typical villain of the day which is a shame as there was potential.The stand out of this movie is Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson who is an amazing badass character and Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo. Valkyrie has a lot of great cool action moments and Hulk just steals the scene every time and since he can speak this time it leads to great moments between him and Thor. Though Hulk isn't in this movie for as long as you think he is which is a shame but understandable since this is a Thor movie still. Jeff Goldblum is the grandmaster with a lively personality and is great in every scene he is in and Karl as Skurge is pretty good as well with his own believable character arc though a relatively small role. Taika Waititi the director as Korg was also very funny as well. The best part of this movie is the amount of colour and design that goes into the sets. Clearly this movie took a lot of inspiration from Guardians of the Galaxy and it definitely shows, They both explore the cosmic side of the MCU and are much more focus on the comedy. The design of the sets though have a Jack Kirby feel to it and that is very fitting for the planet of Sakaar. The action scenes are also very good especially the Thor vs Hulk fight with its great choreography and comedic timing. The action scenes are much more memorable then Spiderman Homecoming and are much more enjoyable to watch in my opinion. The score while not super memorable, still does its job and led zeppelin \"immigrant song\" is a great song.", "Some critics say this movie sets a new standard for the MCU and I honestly don't agree with it. I think this is a really good movie and is most definitely the best Thor movie. However, it does have the feeling of a typical MCU movie. It takes many tropes that have happened in the MCU and amplifies it. This really worked for the movie and creates an enjoyable experience for us. This movie is what we loved about the MCU and that is why it was such a good movie. The fault for this movie is that it doesn't really go in a new direction and still has the common flaws of a MCU movie. Still, if you liked many of the MCU movies then you are going to really love this movie as it feels like a love letter to us fans."]},

Kudos of course should be given to its stellar supporting casts, the usual suspects such as Hiddleston and Rufallo, but also 'newcomers' Tessa Thompson and Cate Blanchett. Biggest weakness? Well, its orientation toward comedy is a double edged sword, lessening the seriousness of some of its set pieces.  Other than that, it's business as usual for the MCU."]},

While Thor and his fallacious stepbrother Loki move to Earth to discover the whereabouts of their father, Hela, their cruel (step)sister, a powerful goddess, rises up from the ashes of the past to send, by force, the pair of brothers to Sakaar, a planet ruled under the jolly way of acting of the Grandmaster, in order to get the throne of his former nation, Ragnarok. To address this, He will face a staggered succession of mishap without his legendary hammer, making use exclusively of his worldly abilities and picking up on the way an irreverent and irregular group of allies who crave, from the deepest part of their hearts, to eliminate vile Goddess of Death before it is too late. Narratively, \"Ragnarok\" possesses heroic avant-garde conjunctures, such as introducing the very first bisexual character within this mega-franchise, fencing two characters in the same Roman war area, playing with more than one antagonist in the same plot, going for broke to cut main hero's powerful blonde long hair, changing abruptly settings by amusingly ordinary circumstances that are poured into utopian and fantastic molds as the coexistence of our stouthearted superhero with a sour-faced roomie into a galactic apartment for a few days, holding dear really the possibilities that comic books have and hundreds more that enable the feature film to differentiate itself radially from the multitude of film genres Marvel Studios has managed to run.", "Perhaps most of the spectators don't agree with my perception, but, in personal terms, visual imagery and artistic work exhibited in the film did not impress me as I expected.Marvel has assumed the hard task of distinguishing, thoroughly, every of its film ideas in any of the work fields, either frictions lying in the lexicon of characters, the distinctive nature of them, the film genre or the artistic scenarios that serve as a home for the stories. \"Ragnarok\" was advertised as a deluge of colors and hilarious events \u2014 both in its narrative strangeness and its splendor in film execution \u2014 never seen before; the posters have been one of the best among the competition and the trailers had a high expectation, in fact, this was fulfilled, however, it worked as a desired allergen for me. In short: \"Thor: Ragnarok\" is like eating up your favorite candies without any limit, after an hour, you're terribly cloyed. Color saturation, paraphernalia and spectacularity attempt to fill a lack of real new landscapes, imaginations that are absent, bombarding with color and artistic eccentricities to excess. Analyzing the sound condition, the feature film seems to have been produced by a mix of talents between Edgar Wright, James Gunn, and Mark Mothersbaugh. Under a prominent influence of classic hits of yesteryear, Waititi's movie promised great things in regard to the original motion picture soundtrack, including, as a starter, no more no less, that Led Zeppelin's revolutionary \"Immigrant Song\" as a fundamental music accompaniment at the first official trailer, a song that also mean a key point in the closing colossal bout. Garnished by compositions created explicitly for the film, the flick switch between classics and proper musical creations at a good pace, it ranks third in the top list of the best scores in the MCU, a merit achieved even though when they aren't entirely original sounds.", "No doubt, the main cause of the triumphant revival of Thor is thanks to this funny filmmaker\u2014 an adjective justly gained. Sinewy God of Thunder has passed through the hands of Kenneth Branagh  and Alan Taylor , however, neither of the two didn't get the opportunity to draw forth his potential in all its splendor, a flaw faded only until the nifty and creative vis comica of the New Zealander emerged as a genuine elixir of life to the character. Without fear of being mistaken, in the marrow of every fascinating feature is this proficient director, his diversity of ideas is absolutely comedic and his film determinations fit in the profile he desires for his projects with great diligence. By dint of a sharp, irreverent and daring perspective, this man has raised a pic of interesting properties, with a heart and a dramatic weight that exceeds in size and visual quality the creative display.", "In sum, \"Thor: Ragnarok\" can be synthesized adequately in a brief and exciting name: Taika Waititi\u2014 of course, not downplaying the fabulous work done by the different areas of the film. Hilarious, visually oppressive and entertaining, Marvel Studios remains high on its prestige as it prepares for a wave of spasmodic and challenging releases, Among which stand out its very first motion picture starring an entirely black cast, its film with a female in the stellar role and the mega-event that will mean \"Infinity War\" when arrives our hearts in May 2018."]},

Ragnarok refuses to take the event or the characters seriously.

The forced relationship between the villain and Thor and Loki is unnecessary, Hela did not have to be their sibling. It could have easily been that she was a rogue warrior, Odin's first wife or even Odin's sister. The fact that they make her Thor and Loki's sister undercuts the relationship between Thor and Loki. The heart of the Thor story is the bond of brothers having Hela come out of nowhere just doesn't add to the development of the main relationship in the Thor arch which is Thor and Loki. She is a good villain though, but she doesn't need to be related. It's forced for shock value. Then it comes down to the biggest issue I have with the movie is the complete lack of development of Characters.  Thor's character has regressed.  He was supposed to become wiser, but he's actually become quite dumb.  He was supposed to become stronger, but he's actually become quite weak... he can't hold his own against the villain and instead of gain strength and confidence he actually becomes weaker. He is no threat to the villain and the villain knows it. He can't save his people and he knows it.  That is rather disappointing for a hero. Also Loki's character, one of the most compelling characters in the MCU who had a beautiful arc gets watered down. His powers, intelligence and personality get watered down. I wanted a cathartic moment between Thor and Loki when they reveal that they need each other and miss each other, but instead everything is played for laughs. Loki's character never had to make a choice to do the right thing... we don't see motivation or the sympathetic emotions that make this character so well loved. The movie is funny, but its no substance. I miss the old characterizations. I miss the poignant emotional moments that Thor and Loki's relationship offered. But the director got what he wanted he made me laugh in theaters and then when I left he made me cry."]},

It has a lot of very funny moments - some are fairly obvious that everyone in my theater laughed at, while others are a little more subtle and require that you've seen other MCU films as they take shots at and make of fun stuff from them, specifically Age of Ultron.  Chances are that if you enjoyed a lot of the \"off the cuff\" / kind of subtle humor present in the first Guardians of the Galaxy, chances are you are going to like Thor: Ragnarok.  At its heart, this is very much a buddy film (with Thor/Hulk and Thor/Loki), but that is part of what made it so enjoyable.  A lot of the best scenes are back and forths between these characters, but it does more to build on their relationships than a lot of the other \"solo\" character MCU films to date.  They were honestly the high point of the movie as it kind of tailed off as the story turned towards the ending (see below for my only complaints with the film).", "In terms of why I didn't give the movie a perfect score of 10 (it came close for me), I really had two main bones to pick with it so to speak.  1) Like a lot of other MCU films, most of the movie centers around the heroes so I can see some feeling this is yet another example of an MCU film not devoting enough time to build up a villain in Hela (played by Cate Blanchett) that otherwise had a lot of potential.", "2) I thought the ending seemed kind of abrupt and rushed.  As I've told friends and co-workers who've asked, part of that may have been the result of the fact that I was enjoying the rest of the movie so much that the ending might  have snuck up on me somewhat.  But there are some...what I'll call \"actions\" I guess taken by Hela (against some of Thor's allies) that I thought would've been better saved for the end as it would've made Thor's decision about how best to fight her carry more meaning.  I don't want to say too much more than that as it would take this review into spoiler territory.", "All in all I really enjoyed the movie and definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys the MCU (even though it is not your standard superhero movie), and also anyone that is a fan of movies like the original Guardians of the Galaxy that are part space opera / part comedy.  I liked it enough that I would put it among my top 5 MCU films to date (with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers film, Captain America: Winter Solider, and the first Guardians of the Galaxy), though I do expect it will likely be surpassed when Black Panther (which is reminding me a lot of Winter Soldier) and Infinity War are released next year."]},

The comedy in the film was fantastic, with plenty of jokes the entire cinema, full of both kids and adults, burst out laughing, although personally I did laugh out loud much more than anyone else. The action scenes in the film were very well written and I was in awe at the fantastic CGI. The inclusion of The Hulk was remarkable, as he had a much more important role than what I'd expect him to have from all the trailers I'd personally seen, and The Hulk was a very nice inclusion into the film. The lead villain, Hela, was one who I loved to hate and the fight scenes with her in were both intense and comedic.

The fight scenes are sensational and the effects were nicely worked Hulk VS Thor was fantastic an unparalleled fight the two battling yet swapping huge blows that make it vibrate with each hit. The scenes of Hela's fight are perfect, Hela (risk telling me that she is the best villain of the UCM) proved to be an overwhelming, deadly and cold force capable of great feats bathing Asgard in blood, it was unstoppable neither Thor, Valkyrie, Loki and others were a match for Hela. Valkyrie was a very well-developed character in the story you can rightly understand her story there in a way yet noticeable race has brought us strong and a powerful cream warrior. The film was very good but still has its low points more comprehensible as in the beginning the fact that we see Sutur as a primordial threat is more quickly forgotten throughout the film, but the motive should be at the end of the films for the purpose that he carries in order to everything else still should be used more."]},

On the other hand I really wanted this to be another LOGAN level good Marvel movie but this movie is barely a even a parody. First of all, calling what is essentially an action COMEDY an apocalypse or \"RAGNAROK\" is Ironic enough but here's what I walked out of the theater with. 1- Regular Machine guns work wonders at mowing down Asgardians. 2- The Cosmic Superpower planet known as Asgard apparently has a population of no more than 2 thousand. They literally walked a 2 lane wide bi-frost bridge and evacuated the planet using a single ship. Couple that with the fact that their best resurrected warriors were manhandled by a guy with 2 machine guns and I can see that conquering New York in \"The Avengers\" was REALLY AMBITIOUS. 3- I don't know who Thor is!!! a rugged warrior, a whimpering baby in the face of a haircut or alien goo, an Obnoxious brat, a self sacrificing hero, a wise and intelligent prince/king, a colossal idiot repeatedly and hopelessly performing black widow's lullaby for the Hulk? 4- Dead father, dead companions, destroyed planet, b#@ch of sister, crumbling throne. Screw it. Lets crack jokes for the audience. (That really did it for me). 5- Loosing an eye is a prerequisite to ruling Asgardians (the 349 ones left anyway). 6- We just blew up out planet to win (Wait what!!!!!). where to mate??? Well take us to earth. They love me there. We'll crash the entire planet's population in the new Avengers headquarters till we figure out what's what.

We usually take turns picking the shows, and for every \"superhero\" movie, I usually choose a biopic or something wonderfully weird, like a Coen brothers film.    So not expecting anything besides the special effects and usual cliched dialogue (if I hear the word \"destiny\" one more damn time . . .) I was pleasantly surprised to find that \"Thor: Ragnarok\" was actually a pretty decent movie.    Following the success of the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" series, the folks behind this movie opted for a lighter and more humorous approach but still kept the special effects dazzling as the other \"Thor\" pictures have been.    So while we get the usual plot, Thor vs. The Hulk gladiator duel notwithstanding, of Hela, the Goddess of Death (boo) whom, after Odin dies reappears and promises the utter annihilation of Asgaard and the universe, one presumes.    So leave it to Hammer Boy and the wishy washy Loki, always well played by Tom Hiddleston to figure everything out and save the universe yet again.    That plot has run its course and I deduct two stars for what has become one of Hollywood's lamest cliches for sci-fi and superhero movies.    What saves it though as I said before is a fresh injection of genuinely funny material, even if it is derivative of \"Guardians\".    After all, humor was not invented just for that pair of movies, but it certainly made the difference between another outer space yawner and a brilliantly hilarious pair of movies.    I do not want to spoil the main parts of the movie that aren't part of the old tried and true formula, but it is indeed fun to see that even superheroes can screw up.    A portal between one planet run by a deceptively evil character played by Jeff Goldblum and Asgaard is referred to as the \"Devil's Anus\", and immediately I could think of a few towns and cities I've been to or worked in that deserve that title themselves.    So if you like the \"Thor\" series anyway, you'll be happy with this one.

I remember reading the run of Ragnarock in the original Mighty Thor comics and This movie lives up to no part of it. Humor, even with the Death of Odin, Humor, even with the destruction of Mjolnir (dumbest move ever) Humor, as Surtur (who is basically non-exist in the film) drives the Twilight sword into Asgard and destroys it (umm, wasn't there supposed to be demons and fighting, not just insert Sword here).  Korg, the great leader of the gladiator resistance turns out to be nothing more then some dim witted \"Spicoli\" wannabe. Hela, the great goddess of Death (and Loki's Daughter not Odins) whos great power is to shoot swords at people...What????

This movie teases you with so many things you always wanted to see on the screen, and delivers on none of them.

This movie, which fans hoped would finally gives us the God of Thunder and be the savior of the Franchise, instead is the death of the franchise.  Helmed by a director who seemed so busy telling jokes he didn't have time to actual read any of the comics, so instead showed you some Fanboy visuals then blew it all up.

No matter how big the last box office or how good the last movie, with each film it is is always trying to get bigger, better, and even re-invent itself. With that however there is always a danger of going too far, and when it comes to their latest film, Thor: Ragnarok they came close. In his third installment Thor learns he must face his greatest foe of all, his long lost sister, who had been locked away millennia ago. She is said to be stronger than even Odin himself and casts Thor and Loki out of Asgard, where they wind up on a strange world, where Thor is forced to compete in a battle royal against an old friend. Thor has always featured arguably the best special effects in the Marvel film franchise, and at least to me, has always been more Science Fiction and therefore the least realistic of any of their modern characters. In an attempt to humanize him more and make him a little more friendly to general audiences, Marvel added a ton of humor to the character in Ragnarok. While I agree, Thor was a little dry, he always had his own wit to him, and by adding all the humor to the character I felt as though it took away from his mystique. Marvel is also using a lot more crossover material in the individual films than they have before. While the followers of the universe love it and call for more, this tends to confuse general audiences, who don't necessarily go to see all the Marvel films. It's a fine line that has to be drawn between pleasing the fans of the universe and the general audience, in order to keep the enormous box office. This time, they managed to tow the line, but the direction suggests that next time they may not be so lucky. As for the cast, again Marvel proves that when it comes to casting for their characters, there is no one better in the business as even Jeff Goldblum fit his role like a glove. Their was a little too much humor for my taste, Thor isn't Deadpool or a Guardian of The Galaxy, but by and large it was still a very enjoyable film.

I think they wasted a great opportunity at making a really good deceiving game with Loki in disguise as Odin. They completely ruined Branaghs initial Shakespearean feel to Thor movies we all loved to make a Guardians like comedy out of it & it was too much.

Cate Blanchett should have brought some menacing gravitas to proceedings.

It is also very humorous but juxtaposes that humor with some very great character moments that I haven't seen in a Marvel film in a long time. It's because of this blend of action, comedy, and drama that I think this movie is worthwhile. However, the movie is a bit unmemorable. Although it will have major ramifications in the MCU, it never felt very serious. The steaks in this movie are not high enough to get one invested really deeply in the overall plot. If it weren't for the humor, visuals and key moments between the characters we love, I honestly would've rated this lower since really the steaks diminish the overall plot of the film.

The fact that director Taika Waititi himself portrayed Korg and directed this fairly stunning nostalgia infused fantasy film only serves to pique the interest in his future projects. Solid performances by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston do not leave any want by the viewer. Hiddleston and Hemsworth can be argued, have the best chemistry to date in the MCU.

Director Taika Watiti has definitely added the much-needed sense of freshness and likability to the character of Thor. The title Ragnarok, which forms the premise of the movie, stands for an important event in Norse mythology that predicts the doom of the gods and the end of Asgard. The story shows that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) reveals a long-kept secret about his past and his first born \u2013 Goddess of Death \u2013 Hella (Cate Blanchett) to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) & Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Later, Thor finds himself trapped in an alien, warlike planet Sakaar, which is on the other side of the universe, and that too without his mighty hammer. He must find an escape and return to Asgrad to confront one of the most powerful forces he\u2019s ever faced. Every character in the movie has done a fabulous job - be it Chris Hemsworth as mighty turned-witty Thor, Cate Blanchett as the dark Goddess Hella, Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster, Mark Ruffalo as the not-so-witty Hulk, or the scene-stealing man of stone, Krog the Kronan, played by Watiti himself.

Thor doesn't seem to go through any meaningful experiences to build character, just some Mufasa-esque \"remember who you are\" mysticism that makes everything okay in the end.

There's another character who for me is funnier than almost anyone in any Marvel film, who I won't mention in case I spoil anything, and I almost missed a scene due to how much laughter was coming out of me. I think the reason some people won't like this movie is because (I don't think so but it could be interpreted this way) the story and plot of the film didn't match the comedic tone, as the story is actually very serious, therefore people might be like 'Why are they wasting their time with jokes when they could seriously expand Thor as a character' etc. . Something major happens early on, and it is quite significant and is quite a 'WOW' moment, yet it isn't really explored, so that aspect might be the movie's downfall for some people.

I was actually a little hesitant to see this since it seemed more Planet Hulk than something from the lore of Thor. The best way I can describe the movie as a combination of both minus all the heavy themes of either. The movie is trying to be a bit too silly and tries too hard to avoid anything serious. For example, anytime a hero wants something on cue, they are delayed, dramatic music stops and they tell whoever to wait, like Thor summoning his hammer and it takes ten or fifteen seconds before it comes. This happens so much that by the time Banner does the same thing near the end where he needed to be the Hulk, you can predictably tell it isn't going to happen right away. The problem with this is that it is not in character. It makes it look like Thor never even used the hammer before or that Banner doesn't know how to Hulk up despite the stress of falling out of a plane should have easily triggered it.", "The best humor was when the characters are being themselves and play off each other rather than trying to be silly. The Dr. Strange scene was probably the best part.

Each scene starts off with Hela upset people don't remember her and then she kills with a bunch of swords. In concept, she's great, but it goes back to being a bit on the repetitive side.", "I wished that the Asgardians put up more of a fight. Two of the Warrior's Three are killed in less time than it takes for it to click on who they are and Lady Sif doesn't even appear. Heimdall was the only one who got decent screen time and while his parts were short, they were well done.  Hela is killing everything and it doesn't feel as dark as it should be. It's not only mostly bloodless, but when people die, they die instantly. Some would say it would ruin the fun, but frankly, if Deadpool can incorporate cancer in a serious manner, why can't the fall of Asgard be treated with a darker tone? The film flows well, except for one section in the third arc. It shows Hela and Scourge are closing in on Heimdall's refugees. She's throwing swords at the door on one side while the others are escaping in the back on a dirt trail with sparse vegetation. Thor says he'll distract her and heads to the throne room. The next moment, there he is and so is Hela. The refugees are on the bridge with Scourge now following after them with soldiers. It's just a strange transition.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["To start off, this movie has a way different feeling than the previous Thor movies, and it pays off in every way.  This movie is first and foremost a comedy that is accompanied with great action sequences.  The first Thor movies didn\u2019t have this framework and focused more on the conflicts and action, with very little comedy throughout either movie.  The jokes in this movie land well almost every time and keeps you vested throughout the whole movie.  I enjoyed that this Thor movie in that it felt like the scale of the MCU increased a ton with the new planets involved and new characters that give history to Thor\u2019s world.  The comedy being in the forefront gives this movie a great advantage because it feels different from its predecessors and can bring in a new audience because it\u2019s so funny and enjoyable to watch, and rewatch when it comes out on blu-ray. Lastly, the side characters in this movie offered great comedic moments to, which is hard to so with characters like that.", "The new villain, Hela, was also a standout to me because she was one of the more compelling villains that the MCU has had in a while.  While the MCU has great heroes, their villains have never been on the same level as other villains, like the Joker.  I would have to say I enjoyed seeing a different villain in the MCU that not only is acted well, but actually is given a clearer motivation than others.  For example, there is a part in the movie where she reveals some secrets about Asgard and it hits you because you sort of can see things Hela\u2019s way and why she is dong whats she\u2019s doing.  Having clear cut, and understanding, motivations makes Hela an MCU villain that is above average compared to other Marvel villains throughout the years.", "This film is pretty great all around, but there are some nitpicks to talk about.  First off, some of the CGI could\u2019ve been cleaned up a little better, like the bad guy at the beginning of the film Thor fights before Hela.  Also, a lot of this movie was improved, from reports, and it does show in certain scenes that they let the actors just go off and talk.  This is by no means a bad thing, but there were some points I could easily tell what was written in the script and what wasn\u2019t.  This made it feel like two different movies at some points because, to me, it felt obvious what was improvised and actually in the script.  Lastly, I didn\u2019t like how how the last joke was delivered, the last moment of the movie is built up as this dramatic moment and it should\u2019ve been that way.  But, the joke took away from what could\u2019ve been a powerful, dramatic moment for Thor.", "In the end, Marvel has another hit on its hands and gives audiences a fun experience.  Along with delivering a Thor movie that feels like what the previous Thor movies should\u2019ve been like all along.  I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end and was laughing throughout while having a good time."]},

This movie has so much style that it's surprising it didn't feel like Suicide Squad with all the jumbled tones being thrown left and right. Taika brings his indie directing style to he forfront and makes (ALMOST) each scene a joy to watch. The writing is good as a Thor movie can be. The performances are out of this world, as everyone brings their A-Game (EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR TEN SECONDS OF SCREEN TIME). Chris Hemsworth proves to all that he is legitamitely funny. Blanchett is always good, though her character is a bit underwhelming at times, but her performance saves it. Goldblum is quirky and weird and fits this movie nicely. Tom Hiddleston brings a bit more depth to Loki, but that's to be expected. Ruffalo shines as the both the Hulk and Banner and brings some of the best laughs in the movie. Everyone is great. Even the action manages to be just as good as ever. Though it may seem I am praising this movie a lot, it SUFFERS badly from ONE massive flaw. Pacing. Just within the first ten minutes alone, you'll feel like you're being whiplashed by J.K. Simmons. It's not that it's start and stop, it's that it's ALWAYS RUNNING. This movie doesn't let up, not even for a moment, which makes it hard to register certain things that happen to characters. Trying to mesh Planet Hulk and Ragarnok works for the most part, but because of this certain things happen to characters that could be huge but is quickly glossed over, and the movie is 2 hours long. So while I love this movie, it suffers from going too fast with the pacing. Luckily, the acting, the story, the characters, and the action save this movie. Plus, because of the pacing, it doesn't even feel like 2 hours. You'll have loads of FUN watching it, which in the end is really all that matters. So go ahead and watch it, then watch it again."]},

Guardians of the Galaxy not only helped elevate the character relationships with humor, but the jokes were not the entire film. Guardians of the Galaxy impressively was not just the funniest mcu film, but also the most emotional. The one dimensional Thor: Ragnarok on the other hand dismisses everything for jokes and when you do that we lose total interest in the story. Even though this is suppose to be the most serious thing that Thor faces, it is treated like a joke. If your not serious then I'm not serious which takes away all interest. I could actually care about what happened in the first two Thor films and they still had jokes that never became jarring like this third installment. I even cared about what happened in The Lego Movie more than I cared about what happened in this film. I have never seen a movie stop me from caring about the plot because of the humor which is what makes Thor: Ragnarok so successful at being bad. The next part of my criticism is a spoiler, but I did not check the box because it does nothing for the rest of the film other than make me drenched in sadness. So basically, because action films despise romance, Thor breaks up with Jane Foster for no reason off screen and to me that is pretty much saying that none of the character development or threats that the characters faced in the first two films really mattered. I already rage quitted on Thor: Ragnarok from that horrendous exposition. It would have been even better if they said nothing or they could have just said she was busy or something much more acceptable. So the question is, why not give this film a zero. Well, Thor: Ragnarok is the only superhero film I have ever seen with a main female villain. That is literally it."]}
