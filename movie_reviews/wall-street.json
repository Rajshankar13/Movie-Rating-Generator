The Wolf of Wall Street is well written, well shot, and clearly well directed overall. The acting is fantastic, especially from Leo  He put in one of the best performances I seen in a long time.  I have never been so universally approving of how a film was put together yet had such a negative reaction to it.\r", "I'm a white male and I don't identify as a feminist, but if this film is indicative of the new norm, I may have to start doing so.  The misogyny in this film is so unforgiving and goes so unaddressed that it simply cannot just be satire or a cultural mirror.  I'm not talking about the hookers either.  Repeatedly, women in this film are shown to be unbelievably weak.  Sex is their only commodity, beauty is the only thing that matters.  When Jack's first wife, with whom he has multiple children, finds him cheating with Naomi, all she can do is cry.  We never see her again. She never even mentions their kids!  Naomi is worse.  Even though she is never presented as anything more than a vapid beauty, she is worshiped.  During her most \"powerful\" scene, the only one where she exerts any kind of force over Jack, she is calling him daddy and giving him blue balls.  During the movie, she is completely powerless to address any of Jack's problems with drugs or cheating.  We never even see her try.  The female lead of the movie is a beautiful accessory and nothing else.  All she has to offer him is sex, and she knows it.  Even the woman who is ostensibly the most female stockbroker at Jack's firm is weak  Jack even gives a teary eyed speech about how she never could have made it if he didn't lend her $25,000 when he gave her the job.\r", "If the intention of this movie was to wake up people like me, who have probably been watching films like this without batting an eye for years, then Scorcese has succeeded.  Many viewers, however, will probably be too taken in by the flashy editing, language, and fantasy to give it a second thought.\r", "It\u2019s a shame that something this destructive has to come in such a well executed package."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["The biggest issue with this movie, which knocked it down from a movie that could have been an 8 or 9 to a 4, was that it was far too long. I really enjoyed the first hour or so of the movie, from Belfort's introduction to the brokerage industry through the creation of Stratton Oakmont and their decision to move away from selling penny stocks solely to lower and middle class folks and instead trying to create relationships (and sell those stocks) to wealthier clients. I enjoyed the initial showing of the opulence, fraud, and craziness that was the Stratton Oakmont at least of Belfort's characterization. But then that portion of the film went on... and on... and on... and it added nothing to the understanding of the characters. I got it at 90 minutes into the film: these were bad men who were willing to do awful things to make themselves as wealthy as possible. The continued at great length portrayals of their awfulness did not make me think they were more awful, but instead took me out of the film and made me so bored that, by the time the action actually picked up again (when Belfort realized he was under investigation, his meeting with the FBI agents, and his move to get his money out of the US), I just couldn't get back into it. The movie could have easily cut a half hour off the run time and I would have felt it would have ended with a better result. For example, I felt the entire IPO Day scene was unnecessary. We already knew Donnie was a jerk, the fish eating/firing scene added nothing. We already knew that, at least according to Belfort, Stratton Oakmont viewed him as a something akin to a cult leader. We didn't need him herding the sheep after Madden tried to speak. That scene also seemed the most hollow and untrue to me in the film.\r", "\r", "I also think the film could have been better had they done some more research BEYOND Belfort's memoir, and didn't just essentially present Belfort's memoir as fact. I would have found it much more interesting to have seen Belfort's rendition juxtaposed with what others (who said the environment was much more tame) said.\r", "\r", "Other point: too much was focused on the Naomi relationship. It was clear from moment one that she liked Belfort solely for his money and the lifestyle he could provide. They didn't need to treat it like it was some crazy reveal, like we didn't get that he was delusional about their relationship.\r", "\r", "I didn't get pulled back into the movie until the very last scene, where Belfort was doing the sales motivational speech, and you got pulled back into what made his group able to pull off the sort of fraud they did: they were able to convince buyers that they needed something that they did not actually need.\r", "\r", "Short version: could have been a great movie, had a great start, but was at least a half hour too long and stuck too close to Belfort's telling as opposed to trying to provide some more objective truth."]},

Scorcese and Di Caprio are two of the biggest names in the current film scene, and both have provided us with some nice films. So I wasn't surprised with the fuss around the movie but, when I saw it, I was very disappointed.", "The film is based on an autobiographical book written by Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who quickly enriched, through financial maneuvers of high risk and zero legality. The book describes not only the business but the life of luxury, drugs and sex that he took, and the way he eventually paid for it. The film, as far as we understand, is quite faithful to the book's account, and the book also makes an apparently true story. The film resembles \"Goodfellas\" in many ways, but with great differences in which the gangster movie gets the better of it. The main problem of this film lies in three essential points: The first point is the apparent glorification of the fraud and Belfort's dissolute lifestyle. The message passed by the film is \"crime pays\". It spends more than an hour telling us, in detail, the outrages of Belfort and his team of bastards without any need, shocking some public, who leave the cinema with the feeling that the film passes an ethically wrong message, and society does not need to receive it because it receives enough bad influences.", "The second essential point is the absence of a counterpoint to the scenes of excesses shown. Okay, Belfort is a swine, drug addict and corrupt who has gotten rich too fast and too easy. So? Where is the counterpoint to that? He committed crimes, but what are the effects of his crimes? Who lost out on Belfort's crimes? How can audiences truly realize the size of his mistakes? The public never gets these answers because the film gets too lost in the details of Belfort's scandals. The movie makes people think that Belfort never harmed anyone, and that he was just crazy, or smart.", "The third negative point is the construction of the characters. They are black-and-white, without the psychological complexity and refinement that we find in \"Goodfellas\", for example. There's no such thing here. The characters are summed up as junkies, sex offenders, eccentrics, some bored cops and little else. DiCaprio was well enough in his role, but being such an abject role, it's impossible to like and enjoy his performance.", "I think Scorcese thought this film as a comedy, but the truth is that it is not funny. The film is morally shocking, not funny. So, it was a bad idea. This film would have been excellent if it had been conceived as a drama and had behind it some moral balance. That was not the case. It is a mad journey through senseless immorality, without notion and without any pretext than easy laughter, and this is quite unpleasant."]},

It\u2019s a portrayal of Wall Street in the 1980\u2019s. If you were alive and over 18 back then you already know this was a time of excess, immorality and corruption.  Scorsese presents all this in truly over-the-top fashion, while offering no insight or enlightenment about any of it.  At 3 hours, the movie is way, way too long.  It drags, in part, because several scenes are repeated over and over.  The movie also borrows heavily from previous Scorsese movies, especially Goodfellas, and you may find yourself saying, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d  What Wolf lacks in originality, Scorsese tries to make up for through excess.  Despite lots of beautiful naked women, Scorsese amps the level of cursing, drug use and orgies to the point where it actually becomes boring and monotonous.  Impossible, you say?  I wish!

Leo\u2019s not very sexy when he\u2019s on Quaaludes (frequently) or when he\u2019s repeatedly cheating on his wives (constantly). Whether you\u2019re male or female, it\u2019s hard to feel much affinity with DiCaprio\u2019s character (Jordan Belfort) and DiCaprio\u2019s acting, while physical in nature (think Matthew Perry-The Whole Nine Yards), isn\u2019t compelling.  Jonah Hill\u2019s portrayal of Donnie Azoff provides some laughs, but ultimately his character isn\u2019t very likeable either. The movie is so uninspiring the only thoughts it provokes are along the lines of, \u201cIf I had that much money, there\u2019s no way I would have screwed things up so badly.\u201d  This movie is for hard-core Scorsese fans only."]},

Then, with his most recent muse Leonardo DiCaprio being in the lead role, it is almost impossible to imagine them working together leading to something horrible. After all, they are like a more refined, and dependable, version of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.\r", "\r", "Characters & Story\r", "\r", "As for the film, the story focuses on one Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who is this highly charismatic man whose ability to inspire is comparable to that of the great villains of history or literature. However, like many villains, things didn\u2019t start off with him going down the wrong path. When we first meet Jordan, he may not be a saint, but his conscious is clean. He has a wife Teresa (played by Cristin Milioti), and simply wants to live a life where monetary worries are something which are foreign and something simply seen on the news. So, with his first entry level job he meets a man named Mark Hanna (played by Matthew McConaughey) who not only mentors him, but is the figure which begins to change Jordan from the man Teresa fell in love with, to a character who you can\u2019t take your eyes off of.\r", "\r", "Unfortunately for Jordan though, after finally passing his series 7 exam, to be an official stockbroker, Black Monday happens. With this event, Jordan is out of a job and Mark is out of his life. However, with Mark introducing him to the taste of the life he always wanted, and Jordan having that old school American, pull yourself up by the bootstraps, mentality, he decides to not let this setback kill his vision of the new American dream: getting rich. So, he first starts out doing penny stocks and then begins building an empire with his workers being the downtrodden of the world, making him rise to a level where he almost seems like Hitler without an army or anti-Semitic views.  Alongside him is a man who helps see his dreams come true, and push them to ruin: Donnie Azoff (played by Jonah Hill). Making for an overall adventure in which we see the usual dramatic rise and disastrous fall of a figure who may have gotten beaten, but seemingly gets the last laugh and lives to fight another day.\r", "\r", "Praise\r", "\r", "First and foremost, there is an obligatory need to praise Leonardo DiCaprio for he will keep you entertained for the full three hours of the film. Through breaking the 4th wall, and all different types of debauchery which usually is only seen on HBO or Showtime shows, we are given a 3D character. One who has all the charm needed to trick people out of money, but at the same time seems like the life he lives and the person he is at heart are continually conflicting with each other. I say that since, despite the yacht, massive ego, and the ability to make a million in a day, there is still this sort of vulnerability, if only slightly. Take note of whenever he is looking at a woman as more than a vagina to stick his dick in, he becomes insecure in almost an inexperienced teen way, making it seem like testosterone is able to create a fa\u00e7ade for when it is time to show off, but during intimate moments, the mask comes off and all that is left is a man with money and ambitions, but someone who also desires someone stable to share all of his profit with too.\r", "\r", "But it isn\u2019t just DiCaprio who gives you an excellent performance. Hill, based off his filmography, seems almost destined to play Azoff, and though he may not go head to head with DiCaprio in terms of prominence, it is hard to deny that as a supporting member, he doesn\u2019t do a hell of a job. Also, I quite admired the use of soul/ blues music throughout the film signaling the shift of Belfort\u2019s rise, and perhaps the best thing about the film is that while it isn\u2019t rolling on the floor funny, it does keep you smiling and entertained all throughout.\r", "\r", "Criticism\r", "\r", "Leading to perhaps the sole criticism I have for this movie: The Ending. Our journey with Belfort creates the type of movie you can foresee watching more than once, just because of all the madness that goes on; however, the ending just feels so anti-climactic after everything that is done. You watch the man throw midgets, money launder, have sex with tons of woman, take as much drugs as possible without having an overdose, and though I realize Belfort, the actual Jordan Belfort, is alive so a definitive ending isn\u2019t possible, I just felt like after skyrocketing and maintaining that altitude, the ending feels like a plane nose-diving and just barely making it onto the runway safe.\r", "\r", "Overall: Must See\r", "\r", "I personally am not a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but it is undeniable that his work with Martin Scorsese took him from Jack in Titanic to a mega star.

This is supposed to be satiric as the downfall eventually comes preceded by uncanny signs of mental decline, but the amount of exposure to substance consumption is staggering.

Now, as for my rating of six, I did not love the movie. I thought it had its pros and cons. For starters, cut the sex scenes down, trim down the use of f u c k (which I am not offended by, but it definitely loses emphasis) and show if Belfort was in any way full of remorse. The second half of the picture is better, gaining personal ground and...well,the whole point was to share this ridiculous story, to batter our minds with a genuine question of \"why?\". My feelings are somewhat mixed. Some scenes are too long when you get th point, entertaining here and there, and it never fails to show you. I am not a prude.

From the immature conversation between Belfort and his mentor, played brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey, to the hilarious but quite juvenile night where Di Caprio and Hill get the strongest high known to man, it is ridiculously entertaining.

Not that he ever really left, his recent films Hugo, Shutter Island, The Departed etc. have all been fantastic and full of Scorsese, but The Wolf of Wall Street truly reverberates the man we love. There are vast swirling sets, sweeping cameras, explosive/implosive characters, assertive narratives told with an expressive pace, brimming bag of laughs and a wicked sense of underlying controversy. Scorsese is truly extraordinary at understanding and communicating his visual language: cinema.\r", "\r", "\u201cAs far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.\u201d Ray Liotta as Henry Hill at the start of Goodfellas is distinctively comparable to Di Caprio\u2019s Jordan Belfort\u2019s opening confession: \u201cThe year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.\u201d Both characters can be interpreted as zealous apprentice wise guys. Belfort and Hills\u2019 journeys are strikingly similar, though Belfort is in the stock market as a supercharged salesman on Wall Street and Hill is pursuing ruthless trades with gangsters on the street in Brooklyn. They both learn the ropes early on, initially innocent. This is soon surpassed by a fast rise through the ranks and become fixated with work, drugs and girls. Who would have thought gangsters and brokers would be so alike?\r", "\r", "What everything boils down to for Belfort, is tasting the sweet smell of success. But, like most over-their-head entrepreneurs, he can\u2019t get enough of the taste, even when he knows the feds are beginning to tread on his back. Lets talk about Di Caprio\u2019s performance here for a second, mind-blowing. It could be the performance of his career, but that can be said for most Di Caprio performances, he is a great actor. However, as Belfort, Di Caprio has really unleashes a charismatic turn as he swings and swaggers through the frame. He was as invigorating and magnetic as Al Pacino playing Tony Montana in Scarface.\r", "\r", "Of course, the soundtrack is entertaining and always tipping and topping and the editing is high-powered and frenetic making all the hustle and bustle seem ten times as ferocious. Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese\u2019s long-term editing partner, has some interesting comments to say in this February\u2019s issue of Sight & Sound. \u201cMarty\u2019s guiding principle in all his films is to never tell the audience what to think, but to make them engage with what they\u2019re seeing and hearing.\u201d As I touched upon earlier, this is Scorsese letting us engage in his visual language how we see fit, he is a master and commander of visual communication.\r", "\r", "There is a particular scene in the film that I wish to note in this heady review. It involves Di Caprio dragging his face along a concrete floor and rolling down a flight of steps, literally. I won\u2019t explain why, but it has to be the most hilarious scene I can ever recall seeing in cinema. \u201cMarty was delighted to see that the actors could all improvise beautifully, and so he made the daring choice to give them lots of freedom to do that.\u201d (Schoonmaker). Most certainly! The improvisation in this film gives it a fresh outlook whilst retaining a remarkably existent presence.\r", "\r", "Lastly, it is important to recognize that this film is an absolute rarity for Hollywood. The Wolf of Wall Street should be cherished and watched over and over, with laughs becoming ever greater. It is a bold screwball comedy about the state of America, then and now, and it is, therefore, not your typical Hollywood package. And, neither is a three-hour film where every frame and beat is wild and virile with a lifetime\u2019s accumulated genius.\r", "\r", "If this film came out in 2013, it would be side-by-side with the other three-hour epic at my number one spot, Blue is the Warmest Colour.

The amazing thing is that this movie does all this in all the right ways to make a movie that will blow you away and leave you thinking about it after the credits. I cannot talk about anything else without mentioning Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as the main character. He is absolutely phenomenal, and this film just adds to all the other career-defining performances he has done. He perfectly captures what this man in real life was. Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, and Rob Reiner also do amazing performances. All the others did fine jobs, but some characters were underdeveloped. Seeing this man's journey felt extremely powerful over this 3 hour long film, but it moves at such a quick rate that it comes out as even more entertaining. With that quick pace, though, it adds minor plot holes to the film, but there nearly non-noticeable. The drama is amazingly done, along with the sharp-as-blades writing. Yes, this film is very, very brash and/or repulsive, but it makes sense with the story for it to just show how corrupt Belfort's and the people he worked with lives were. The film also sprinkles in a little bit of humour, but I wish it were a larger portion of the movie. The Wolf of Wall Street will go down as one of Martin Scorcese's best films, along with one of DiCaprio's best performances ever. The minor flaws are so overshadowed by the rest of the amazements.

I'm not sure yet, if I like The Wolf of Wall Street more than Gangs of New York or The Departed, but it's easily Scorsese's best directorial effort since Goodfellas. You can feel the energy of the film, which is exhilarating and that no doubt is due to Scorsese.\r", "\r", "My only complaint about the movie is that the final hour was not as good as the first two. The first two hours were the best I've spent at a movie in years and that is not an exaggeration. The final hour is good, but not excellent like the first two. The problem resides with the screenplay and story, which I feel jumps a little too much towards the end, causing the film to be a little hard to follow at times. The final shot of the film, however, is brilliant and clearly indicates the point of the film, that Jordan Belfort's life is something we want and have to allowed to happen. Maybe after repeated viewings I will see the final hour differently, but it certainly did not detract from my enjoyment o the film.\r", "So my advice, to those of you that have not seen the movie, is to ignore those that say the film is a glorification of immoral behavior because their just simply wrong.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Per raccontare la vita sciagurata di Jordan Belfort, Scorsese recupera la struttura di uno dei suoi film migliori in assoluto, \u2018Quei bravi ragazzi\u2019. In entrambi i casi, alla base c\u2019\u00e8 la (auto)biografia del protagonista che racconta la propria parabola esistenziale senza risparmiarsi le peggiori abiezioni, ma lasciando una vaga sensazione di nostalgia per i giorni di gloria a dar l'impressione che il pentimento non sia proprio completo: la sceneggiatura (qui firmata da Terence Winter) la trasforma in un racconto in prima persona, con la voce sopra del protagonista che, d'ogni tanto, si rivolge direttamente allo spettatore guardando in macchina mentre attorno a lui la sua storia procede a ritmo adrenalinico, quell'adrenalina che \u2013 grazie ad abbondanti aiuti chimici \u2013 sostiene gli insaziabili personaggi che la popolano. Se Henry Hill aveva sempre voluto essere un gangster, Jordan Belfort ha come unico scopo i soldi a qualsiasi costo per fare la bella vita (non per niente, la sua ispirazione \u00e8 stato il Gordon Gekko de \u2018l'avidit\u00e0 \u00e8 bella\u2019 in \u2018Wall Street\u2019): entrambi verranno fregati, alla fine, dalla sensazione di onnipotenza che un'impunit\u00e0 troppo prolungata procura loro, oltre alla perdita del controllo dovuta ai troppi stupefacenti. Belfort \u00e8 un ingordo: di sesso, alcool, droga e, ovviamente, del denaro che serve a comprarli. Forte di una grande capacit\u00e0 di venditore con un tappeto sullo stomaco, inizia a piazzare titoli spazzatura a sprovveduti piccoli investitori confidando sulla magnetica attrattiva che i soldi facili hanno su chiunque: quando, dal piccolo gruppo di disperati che ha raccolto, la sua societ\u00e0 inizia a diventare una potenza grazie anche a commissioni salatissime, comincia una caccia all'investitore istituzionale e, da una posizione in bilico su ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 consentito, ci si inoltra sempre pi\u00f9 nei territori dell'illegalit\u00e0, inevitabile calamita per l'attenzione dei federali che - un po\u2019 per testardaggine, un po\u2019 per fortuna \u2013 finiranno per incastrarlo. Varie critiche sono piovute sul film perch\u00e9 non mostra le conseguenze delle azioni del protagonista e della sua societ\u00e0, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la gente che ha distrutto i propri risparmi inseguendo i sogni di ricchezza promessi da un pugno di truffatori senza scrupoli: sarebbe per\u00f2 stato uscire dal seminato del racconto, tanto pi\u00f9 che, dalle loro azioni, si capisce benissimo che genere di persone fossero Jordan e compagnia (se non bastasse la brutale spiegazione su come funziona il brokeraggio affidata al trasformista McConaughey poco dopo l'inizio). Il giudizio su di loro \u00e8 difatti spietato, un gruppo di persone moralmente abiette, pronte a bruciare le montagne di soldi malamente fatti in orge propulse da quantit\u00e0 industriali di droghe: i rapporti sessuali, anche di gruppo, e gli intossicamenti vari si sprecano \u2013 compreso un corso in Quaalude per chi si fosse perso quello nei romanzi di Ellroy \u2013 e non stupisce allora che il film abbia una produzione indipendente, lontana dagli studios. Di questa bella gente, Belfort \u00e8 il leader assoluto, un avido e spietato bastardo dentro che distorce il mito, molto statunitense, dell'uomo che si \u00e8 fatto da s\u00e9, ma che \u00e8 una sorta di dio per chi lavora per lui e ne condivide gli \u2018ideali\u2019. Interessato solo a se stesso, non si limita a fregare gli sconosciuti clienti, ma chiunque gli stia intorno se solo c'\u00e8 da guadagnarci in qualche modo: ovviamente fedifrago nei confronti delle due mogli (anche se la seconda ha le mirabili fattezze di Margit Robbie) e, infine, disposto a tradire i suoi soci per scampare una pena ben pi\u00f9 dura dei tre anni che gli vengono comminati. Nei suoi panni, DiCaprio \u2013 che \u00e8 stato il motore del progetto \u2013 \u00e8 semplicemente perfetto, dando un'ulteriore testimonianza di una maturazione attoriale ormai compiuta: non da meno \u00e8 il resto dello smisurato cast, nel quale non si pu\u00f2 non sottolineare la bravura di Jonah Hill nei rotondi, esagitati panni del sodale di sempre Donnie. Scorsese racconta le loro avventure puntando sul registro dell'ironia acida piuttosto che su quello del dramma, tenendo alto il ritmo grazie alla serrata scrittura di Winter (sulla quale gli attori sono stati spesso liberi di improvvisare) e a scelte visive che sanno colpire per la loro efficacia, a partire dalla decisione di utilizzare un montaggio irregolare e lenti anamorfiche (la fotografia \u00e8 di Rodrigo Prieto) quando i personaggi, e in particolare Jordan, sono strafatti. Ne escono cos\u00ec numerose scene da ricordare, ad esempio quando Belfort incontra per la prima volta l'agente Denham (Kyle Chandler) a bordo del proprio yacht oppure tutto il lungo episodio dello sballo da Quaalude. Quest'ultimo d\u00e0 anche lustro a una terza ora complessivamente pi\u00f9 debole e faticosa delle due, al limite della perfezione, che la hanno preceduta: una perdita di ritmo che abbassa di qualche decimale il giudizio complessivo anche per colpa della sconcertante banalit\u00e0 dell'episodio \u2018italiano\u2019 ."]},

There was much talks about the film and the way it glorifies the explosive, hedonistic ways of the wealthy one percent. But despite all the \"coolness\" we are seeing on the screen, is it indeed a glorification or simply a backhanded representation of these drugged out, sex crazed \"fiends\". Terrence Winter's expletive laden script, was darkly hilarious! I call this the funniest film of the year. The screenplay was incredibly smart and builds a band of memorable characters; with due credit to Scorsese's direction and the supporting cast's (and ofcourse Leo's) electric performances. However I did take a little issue with the length of the story which wielded a staggering three hour run-time on film. Detailing the meteoric rise and fall of the infamous stock broker was a meteoric accomplishment for Scorsese and his usual editor Thelma Schoonmaker.

More interesting is what he does with his new found fortune: what follows is a heady tale of excess and debauchery based on Belfort\u2019s own memoirs.\r", "\r", "Despite the more recent financial turmoil, or perhaps because of it, the image of the \u201880s stockbroker has resurfaced for a new generation. Belfort\u2019s story strays into the early \u201890s, but the general aesthetic of the era has the same nostalgic feel, and the messages seem to be the same. Even if we openly loathe bankers, there\u2019s a voyeuristic fascination in watching their decadent lifestyle \u2013 or what we imagine such a lifestyle to be like: high stress, fast living, dubious morality and plenty of drugs and sex to boot. The Wolf of Wall Street gives its audience a welcome window into this world.\r", "\r", "The story begins when Jordan arrives in the city as a bright eyed, newly qualified broker; having already achieved his youthful dream of working on Wall Street. After an initially unwelcome brief induction into a life of cocaine and lunchtime cocktails by his new boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) the rug is pulled out from under his feet, and he soon swaps blue chips for penny stocks, trading shares worth a fraction of a dollar from a Long Island brokerage on a strip mall.\r", "\r", "Upon realising that these unlisted stocks can fetch a much higher commission than blue chips, he decides to go into business with a bunch of unscrupulous buddies who know a thing or two about sales, using their silver tongues to make millions by trading them on a massive scale, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. For in truth he is committing outright stock fraud \u2013 the details of which are fairly complicated; even Belfort himself chooses not to bore us with the details with his tongue in cheek narration.\r", "\r", "The stellar cast is rounded out by players including Jonah Hill, as Belfort\u2019s toothy associate Donnie, Rob Reiner as his complicit accountant father Max Belfort, and Jon Favreau as lawyer Manny Riskin.\r", "\r", "The movie treads a thin line between satire and glorification, but Jordan is undoubtedly the hero of the piece, and the FBI agents on his trail the antagonists he must outwit. As an audience, we are invited to his party, and we witness nothing of the effects that Belfort\u2019s deceptions have had on those who were duped into buying his shares \u2013 bearing in mind these \u2018customers\u2019 are average people parting with their savings, not huge companies dealing in huge sums of money. This disconnection effectively puts us in Belfort\u2019s shoes: much as they must have appeared to him, they are mere voices on the end of a phone.\r", "\r", "But Jordan is not portrayed as completely heartless. No matter how large his company grows, swelled with a never-ending number of skilled and promising applicants, his loyal gang of hometown reprobates are never left behind, and maintain high-ranking positions until the end. Even when arrested, and forced to wear a wire by the FBI, he attempts to warn Donnie, rather than let him incriminate himself.\r", "\r", "Gratuitous drug use and sexual content aside, the film\u2019s vulgarity can perhaps be summed up by its smashing of the record for the most uses of the f-word in a mainstream non-documentary film, at the rate of around three a minute. The only film scoring higher is a documentary devoted to the word.\r", "\r", "Much of the decadence is played for laughs, or at least as a showcase of extravagance, but coupled with the basic shock value of the actions themselves. One memorable sequence sees Belfort snorting cocaine to counteract the effects of a powerful sedative, paralleled with the Popeye cartoon playing on the television in the background.\r", "\r", "The film does little to condemn Belfort \u2013 although his lifestyle unravels, and he is ultimately incarcerated, any true comeuppance is minimal. This is a reflection of the truth: Belfort\u2019s sentence was just four years, of which he served less than two, which, if the film is to be believed, were in a comfortable minimum security environment for white collar offenders.\r", "\r", "These days, he still makes a handsome living as a motivational speaker lecturing on sales technique, and of course, anyone who gets their autobiography made into a Scorsese picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio must have lucked out in the long run."]},

Personal prejudice with the subject matter. While watching this movie, you wait for redemption or at least true punishment. You expect Jake LaMotta to live a sad life, Henry Hill to crumble and Joe Pesci was doomed in both Goodfellas and Casino. They were satisfying endings because in the moral mind of the audience, they reaped what they had sown. I don't believe I am spoiling anything when I say Belfort has not really been given, what most of our recently recession minds would consider, a gigantic cross to bear. I believe the mixed reviews you are seeing have a lot to do with the time of release. Most people won't get past the \" These are the clowns that killed the economy\" feeling. The Wolf comes at you hard and doesn't let up. It is a spot-on take of the excess of boiler room bandits. Movie making wise, Scorsese remains a master and his muse DiCaprio brilliant. Another time and another place, maybe I would enjoy it. For me, it was too exhausting. It was excess on the excess. I know it was real to the core, I have met some of the characters.

Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did after Apocalypse Now? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70's-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie?\r", "\r", "When I first saw Raging Bull in 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I'm still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it's rightful owner. And I'm still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that's like expecting Tarantino to top Pulp Fiction. There's a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one up Citizen Kane.\r", "\r", "After Raging Bull, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion, Goodfellas is not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn't risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940's never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty's alley. It's been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta's youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn't registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made?\r", "\r", "The Wolf of Wall Street is another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It's afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child's birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an \"A\" for effort. They couldn't have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax? A truly great director from Kurosowa to, well, Scorcese-(circa 1979) would have plotted the rise and fall of a maniacal protagonist along deeper and more affecting lines even at the risk boring its audience for one minute."]},

It's a bit like the money starts slowly and it ends with \"I do not know where to put it\". The evolution of the exploitation of the fault is long, can be a bit too much. The hunt is short.

And actually, the audience doesn't technically have to be compelled by a movies characters. However, they do have to understand why the characters do what they do. In fact, most of the characters in the film start off as very compelling, the other side of their arch is when they turn into outrageous pigs."]},
