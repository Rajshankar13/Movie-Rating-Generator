Webb, who went on to direct two instalments of our friendliest neighbourhood superhero, re-casting Peter Parker with Andrew Garfield, [in our opinion] the best Peter Parker we have seen so far, was unable to tap into what made Summer so great, and really showed audiences how little creativity and imagination exists inside studio tentpole films. Sadly, while Webb\u2019s Spider-Man films went on to make a ton of money, it proved that just because your movies make money after such a beloved independent film, does not mean that audiences actually adore your body of work.

Mary, unable to contain her big personality in such a little shell, is beyond herself and really not able to contain her spunky personality. Noticing her immense gift and talents, Principle Davis is willing to give Mary a free ride and ticket to a prestigious private school nearby. Frank, who gives his own very convincing case, declines all of the offers given to Mary, insisting she live a normal life filled with childhood instances, friendships and most of all, playfulness.", "While Frank and Mary seem to be blending into their humble and comfortable lives in Florida, both of their lives are shaken drastically with the emergence of Frank\u2019s mother (Mary\u2019s grandmother) Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), who believes that Mary\u2019s mind is a gifted one-in-a-billion mathematical prodigy mind, who should continue her late mother\u2019s legacy and begin working, while still a child, on the Millennium Problem, given her very abstract and young handle of advance calculus problems and solutions.

Director Marc Webb ('(500) Days of Summer') tells the story of a freelance boat repairer named Frank (Chris Evans) who ends up going into a legal battle with his mother (Lindsay Duncan) for custody rights for his intelligent niece Mary (Mckenna Grace), who happens to excel at solving complicated maths equations. Upon her first day at school, her teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate) is impressed at her skill to quickly solve maths problems, but is also dismayed at her attitude towards other people. Mary isn't as sociable with people in her age group, and likes to spend most of her time with adults, since she is able to talk to them about things she finds interesting. I admired this movie enough to get on board emotionally with the characters, it's very well crafted, and at times, it can be emotional. Mckenna Grace has a bright future for someone as young as her, and she and Evans carry this movie effortlessly. The only problem here is that the story is not unique, there are other movies - arguably better ones - out there that tell these stories, and provide them with original twists. This movie pretty much walks down the path you expect it to, as far as writing goes. 'Gifted' is the kind of movie you watch for the characters and the acting, but the story could have used more of an emotional punch, and maybe a more original execution.

And best of all is the relationship between our two main characters that is the build block that maintains the whole picture. As noted, it does have flaws, some scenes are clearly pointless and some of the relationships between characters apart from the main two are bland and not very well fleshed, and unfortunately they don't make the \"villain\" if you want to call it that, very relatable, which in the first place it's the issue. The fact that at no point in the film I found myself saying \"Oh, yes I can relate to her, this is clearly a tough situation\" is proof of a failure in the movie's part for presenting a compelling narrative in that aspect.
