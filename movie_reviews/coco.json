{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["\"Coco\" is Pixar's 19th film. It comes out exactly 22 years after the release of the studio's very first film, \"Toy Story\". Pixar reinvented the animation genre by using computer animation to tell smart, family friendly, beautiful and creative stories. Even though the studio has seen a drop in quality as of late, \"Coco\" is definitely a return to form.", "It tells the story of Miguel Rivera, a young musician who lives in the village of Santa Cecilia in Mexico. His family has banned music though, so he is struggling to make his dreams come true. But everything will change once he transports to the Land of the Dead and tries to find his icon, Ernesto de la Cruz.", "\"Coco\" faithfully presents the Mexican culture and people, making you not just want to visit the country, but want to live there. But not to the expense of the story. It's smart, beautifully told, filled with strong and complex characters, incredible music and a message that's powerful and though-provoking. \"Coco\" is a must see for families and fans of animation. It's a masterpiece and meets the high bar set by the studio's earlier works."]},

Pixar has gifted us with yet another wonderful and heartfelt film so get the tissues ready.", "Miguel longs to be a musician but with his family's strict ban on all things music he is forbidden to even hold a guitar. On the night of D\u00eda de Muertos Miguel enters the Land of the Dead to find his great great grandfather, the legendary singer Ernesto del la Cruz. As with most Pixar movies you're hit with comedy and sadness all at the same time, and Coco doesn't hold back. It's funny, emotional and thoroughly enjoyable. The music is beautiful, the array of colours in the land of the dead is mesmerizing. The attention to detail surrounding this beautiful story is worth the ticket price alone. It really is true that the best kids movies are ones adults can enjoy too and you will fall in love with this movie. Pixar has always been better with original ideas as opposed to sequels just for the sake of it so if you enjoy a good animation Coco is not to be missed. Highly recommended, it's stunning."]},

For some reason, they seemed to really not want to settle for anything less than perfect with Coco.  Unlike Disney's older, earlier use of CGI where they'd achieve a large background or hundreds of characters in the distance by cloning the same character over and over like the armies in Mulan, Disney had 2D artists meticulously detail every single building in the background.  It was similar to Hayao Miyazaki's use of highly detailed background mixed with simple characters in the foreground.", "2. I think I'd give it a 7 actually, I think the plot had a bit of fat that could have been trimmed and as another reviewer mentioned, it lacks the classic constantly near-perfect Pixar humor, but I'm bumping up the rating slightly because some reviews are giving it a zero because using a handful of Spanish words and referencing South American and Spanish culture is now an \"SJW liberal agenda.\"  The film is just a cute Day of the Dead story.", "3.

The only issue I have that keeps it from being a perfect film is the story, I was able to predict most of the twist and part of the ending, it does do some of the typical Disney tropes where the boy tries leave the family to pursue his dreams that the family forbids him to do, but it doesn't ruin the film, because It works in the film's favor, it helps give it even more charm that it already has. In short, Coco is a fantastic film with so much to love about it and even if the story can be predictable with the some of the typical Disney plot, it doesn't take away from the film, but it gives it more to love about it.

I went with some friends to a night time showing and I think it's safe to say we all enjoyed the film. Scoring this movie was really hard for me because if we were to look at letter grades, it definitely would be somewhere in the B-range for me but where? An 80% seemed too low but something closer to 90% seemed too high. I think it would be hard to counter that the illuminating scenery was anything less than magnificent.  I don't think a scene went by where I was not in awe of the pure beauty of the movie from the spirit guides to the bridge; I think the best word to describe it would be \"enticing!\" Even the opening which was not lit up was gorgeous and was reminiscent of Hercules or Beauty and the Beast. The music was also stellar and I felt hypnotized by the guitar. I had extremely high expectations because Lee Unkrich is credited as the sole director of TS3, which I think is a perfect film, but I don't exactly think Coco was. I feel like there was a lot less humor in this film as compared to most Disney or Pixar films and that the jokes just didn't hit quite as much as they could. It was also a bit predictable plot wise which being a family film is forgivable but doesn't add to the score? I will say I feel like my experience watching this film was very similar to my experience watching ET. I didn't think I was that connected until the end when the drama hit and I started choking up, and for clarification sake , I've never cried in a movie, so choking up is about as far as I get. Overall, this won't crack my top five movies of 2017 but I'm willing to say it will hit my top ten. I definitely think you should go see it but I don't think it is the best Pixar film we've ever had. * And then the little foot note that is Olaf's Frozen Adventure. I didn't like the Frozen short before Cinderella, and I think this was better but oof. There was exactly one joke, where Olaf is being a savage, that I just started balling out laughing and is probably the only time I purely laughed while I was at the movie. But, other than that, it was tedious. Yes, I'm probably being too harsh on it but the movie ticket said 7:45, OFA started at 8:00, and that's a 20 minute short of all these discombobulated D-rate songs.
