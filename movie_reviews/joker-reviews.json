We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him.

Honestly... just when I was starting to lose faith in the movie industry this comes along and blows me away, it gave me that feeling of \"finally! A movie we've been desperately needing in the age of reboots and remakes and remasters and live cartoon adaptations and political correctness BS\" this is the direction the movie industry has to go and keep going. It's exactly what I personally always wanted as a Joker movie, a character study analysis about a broken man. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an award for his performance he killed it and honestly crushes all the previous Joker's that came before him that we've seen on screen and that's a huge statement. That laugh will send chills of disturbances down your spine every single time. It's a mix of sadness, confusion and just downright creepy I will even dare to say it's better than Mark Hamill's laugh. Make of that what you will. Acting? Superb!! Atmosphere and tone was perfect for this style of movie very depressing. Story? I won't spoil but it is very engaging, makes you think and you definitely feel for the Arthur. You'll be asking yourself questions even after the credits roll.

Also - the snowflakes crying about wanting this banned because of violence? Ha... there was hardly any. I think other movies are worse in that regard, more drama than action if anything so no it won't promote a mass shooting or anything like that if anything it helps raise awareness on helping the mentally ill.

Joker is a fantastic film and a fantastic comic book film. Although the film is great, there are a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, most of those issues are spoiler related so I can\u2019t talk about them. The one I can talk about is that the film does sometimes borrow a little too much from the films it is inspired by, Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). If you have seen either of those films and watch Joker then you will know what I am talking about. Other than that and my spoiler related issues, the film is almost perfect. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as the Joker. You can barely recognize that it is him because he just disappears into this role. The way Joaquin Phoenix shows this slow downfall of his character is incredible. Robert De Niro also does a fantastic job with his limited role. He\u2019s cold, calculating, and manipulative and it\u2019s perfect. The sequence of events that the film portrays is perfect. It doesn\u2019t quickly get to the \u201cJoker\u201d but spends most of the film showing the slow downfall of his character. The film does this to perfection. This film is incredibly dark. There are multiple moments in the film that your jaw just drops at what happens. The film uses violence to its advantage. The scenes where it is used in adds to the already huge amount of tension that has been built up which leads me to my next point, Joker is incredibly tense. There are multiple moments where events are slowly building up and you are just on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax of that scene and when it happens, it feels super satisfying. The score for this film is amazing also. Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir has so many outstanding compositions that adds to the tension and gives us an insight into Arthur\u2019s mind. The cinematography is surprisingly really good. It always provides a way to show us how Arthur is feeling while also getting other necessary shots. Joker is a film that has to be experienced on its own. Ignore the controversy behind it and try not to pay too much attention to the critic reviews. You have to see the film and depending on how you feel the film portrays issues like violence and mental illness will determine if you like it or not. Overall, Joker is exactly what comic book films needed with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix and an interesting, dark, and realistic approach  into an iconic character.

The character is effectively a sick person suffering from mental illness in the looks for help that doesn't come his way, and is additionally mistreated by society- hence creating the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix did a tremendous job portraying the character, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets to be a candidate for best actor at the Oscars because he did a phenomenal performance. If I have an issue with the movie, it is the use of sound-the soundtrack overall is very good with violin pieces setting the depressing mood of the film, but in some instances the sound seemed intrusive- trying too hard to set an emotion or a moment instead of the actual film doing that by its own, creating a sense of superficiality to some of the scenes.

This film uses current world issues to add plausibility to it's story, you never quite find yourself empathizing with Arthur, but you can understand how he gets to be the Joker and why. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic in this movie, you really can't help but think of how short changed Jared Leto must be feeling right now.

For a comic book movie movie, it's a pretty unique script, but compared to other films like this, it doesn't do this kind of story as well. It's a little slow n parts and its dialogue is nothing special, but this is still a pretty well written movie, with symbolism left and right and a satisfying, yet tragic, arc for its protagonist.

As opposed to typical fluff and cartoonish action scenes, however, this film doesn't horse around with pale expectations from the supervillain-following crowd.  \"Joker\" takes itself entirely seriously and unapologetic in it's many-faceted presentation of the main character, played by former renegade actor Joachin Phoenix, with the apparent attempt to dissect this guy's psyche' within the framework of a totally serious explanation of humour vs. tragedy and evil vs. good.  To the surprise of few, these analytics go only so far, leaving the audience to stitch the elements together for themselves.", "The effort was noble, successful in a limited sort of way given how hampered this film is by some rather intrusive flaws.  First and foremost to my eye -- or more precisely, to my ear -- is miscasting Phoenix as a clown who doesn't quite get the clown-laugh down convincingly; then again, perhaps this was an intentional faux pas (either by Direction or good Acting) in conveying Arthur Fleck's (Joker's) strain and frustration in playing the part of a professional funny man, when his personal life is in ruins.

Tho it may be a facsimile of \"Joker\"'s intent to date it relative to its setting and scenes' demands, Franklin's jokes and one-liners were awfully lite and minimally funny -- once again a probable counter-play to Fleck's ironic humorous twists, given that he is by this point in the picture revealed as a murderer.", "Another example of surreal connection to an earlier cinematic work was when rioting clowns protesting the mayoral campaign of Tom Wayne -- that's right, the father of future crime-fighter Batman -- began chanting something along the lines of \"We're mad as hell and won't take it anymore !!\" a la 1975's landmark movie \"Network\" starring Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway.

Instead, we have a much more complex story, of a man who\u2019s genuinely motivated to be as good as he knows how to be, and has that eroded in ways that we can see and understand.", "It\u2019s easy enough to see him as a psychopath. But Fleck is a person who descends into his madness for reasons we can see and perhaps even understand. There\u2019s another stream to this film. Fleck commits his act of savage violence while wearing his clown make-up. That oddity is interpreted as an act of rebellion by Gotham\u2019s disenfranchised to wear clown masks in solidarity, and then commit acts increasingly violent civil disobedience.", "We are, of course in Gotham, not the real world. Gotham is a city that is a dystopian version of New York, and a version of humanity working at a heightened-reality level of antagonism and violence.", "And yet, in a time in our history where people feel deep divisions, the movie is perhaps a little too close to home for comfort.", "At the centre of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix, who won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for this role. Phoenix is simply one of the best actors in contemporary film, with a staggering range. He\u2019s an un-showy actor who does a deep dive into his characters, and unlike many Hollywood stars, he\u2019s willing to take on roles that repulse.   In Joker, he disappears into Fleck and takes him from a dutiful son, to a confused man, to the psychopathic Joker character in a seamless arc. When he finally becomes Joker, Phoenix does a dance down a staircase, as if all burdens of the world have been lifted off of him. He has been released, and is embracing himself with a kind of joy that belongs to the damned. It\u2019s a glorious performance and a terrifying moment in a film that revels in its dark heart."]},

Instead, it feels like Phillips knew he needed to show some gruesomeness\u2014or perhaps he just wanted to ramp up the shock factor\u2014so he wedged a few bloody scenes into the script.  Worse, a lot of the scenes were shot using a heavy filter, which to us made it feel like we we watching a movie-within-a-movie, which itself provided an emotional filter distancing us from the story unfolding on screen.", "Lastly, leading up to this weekend, plenty of people have made comparisons between \u2018Joker\u2019 and Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u2018Taxi Driver.\u2019  Sure, Todd Phillips borrows a lot of imagery from the classic, especially the handgun gesture Arthur Fleck uses all too often.

No one sees him as a hero. Understanding why someone does something, doesn't mean you agree with it. Saying a kid has mental issues as a reason he shoots up a school, doesn't mean you agree with it.

However, after all the comments and articles about how this movie is absolutely removed from everything from the comics, I expected just a good movie with a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Then, when I actually saw the movie I was really surprised. Because not only it was a great movie itself, but it was also a brilliant version of that world from the comic books and a Joker himself. It really reminded me of ''the Killing Joke'' that did something similar with the character of Joker. It made you feel empathy towards him, but at the same time you were not rooting for him, it made him more human. He was just a crazy person that had a rough life. He wasn't really a supervillain, which explains why Batman was even trying to help him in the end, but it was too late. Well, that's basically what happens in this movie. It just chooses a different path. It doesn't make him crazy through a chan of chemicals. It doesn't do it in one day. A few days. Or maybe even a life. You can see why Batman would do the same thing. Why he would try to help him. But just like in the comic, because of everything that happens in this movie, it would have been too late for that. So, as a fan of batman comic books, I was extremely happy. But again, it was also a great film in general. Cinematography, script, acting, directing, the score. Especially the score! It's the best score that I've heard this year. And of course, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is just incredible. It's hard even to describe, you just have to see it. And no surprise that there is so much controversy around this film. Because it is controversial. It talks about difficult topics, but it doesn't hold one particular point of view on them. It's up to you how to interpret it. And I just wish people would try to look at this film from different angles, rather than just claim that their point of view is the only one."]},

To me for the most part I never really saw any controversy, I knew going in that Joker was a villain and I expected the movie to show me the violent acts of the Joker character and yes some of the violence is brutal but was never glorified or overblown like in some R-rated movies(lookin at you Hellboy, no cap) but the purpose of the movie was to show you how someone can go from being a normal person and be broken by life and turn into a psychopath.", "Okay now let\u2019s move on to the performances, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it somewhere and I\u2019m gonna say it again Joaquin Phoenix was dope playing the role of Arthur Fleck/Joker. I usually don\u2019t care for the oscars but I would like this man to win one. Joaquin made me feel sympathy for Arthur throughout the movie and potrayed Arthur\u2019s mental health issues perfectly and when he turned into the Joker...I enjoyed his performance man. Robert Deniro as Murray Franklin (a talk show host) was good, Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck (Arthur\u2019s mother) also gave a convincing performance as well. Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne was also interesting as the movie gave a very different version of Thomas Wayne from other Batman related movies. The character of Thomas Wayne was almost cruel and colder than any other versions from the comic or movies and I appreciated that a lot.", "Zazie Beetz as Sophie was meh I mean she didn\u2019t give a bad performance by any means it\u2019s just that she was used for a certain plot point and twist that I saw coming from a mile away and I felt that her arc or character even was unneeded and her contribution to Arthur\u2019s story would have been fine without her character.", "One thing I was worried about was that people in the movie were going to be unrealistically cruel to Arthur, however that wasn\u2019t the case the movie handled that part pretty well and again I appreciated  that. The story of Arthur becoming Joker took its time and didn\u2019t rush his transformation, the movie really made you understand Arthur\u2019s life, his dreams, mental state, relationships with certain people and his interactions before everything turns upside down and starts doing Joker ish. Arthur\u2019s downfall was heartbreaking to watch and you felt the consequences of being cruel to other people.", "However although I really liked that the movie took its time with the story and was really patient....I don\u2019t really like the slow burn feel to this movie , its  it\u2019s not that i require an action sequence every 15 minutes it\u2019s just that some movies take unnecessary time and energy trying to deepen the story or character motivations and the pace of the movie can become very slow and drag on. Joker was never 100% boring to me but there were times that the movie almost became a drag to watch. The third act alone is a solid 10/10 you not only get to see the Joker character in full force but the themes that the movie was trying to convey come full circle, it became brutal, almost heartbreaking, tense and wild. Especially with its themes about people being unnecessarily cruel to one another. The key theme about how someone can turn evil after a series of bad things happening to someone, being an outcast in society basically how the world can be a cruel place and how some people will break under that pressure.", "Also what I really really liked that the movie never preaches about these themes but mostly uses the show don\u2019t tell method almost the entire movie except very few instances whereby the movie tells you it\u2019s themes through characters. Without saying too much my favorite scene of the movie was the interaction between Joker and  Murray.", "The movie had a dark tone to it and worked really well, the movie wasn\u2019t  dark for the sake of being dark and there were some funny moments, not a lot since it was a very serious but had funny moments mostly dark humor I mean it\u2019s a Joker movie so there are. A few nitpicks are that you don\u2019t get to see the Joker character for long until the last act of the movie I get it\u2019s an origin story but I wished there could have been a little more Joker scenes but it\u2019s not a negative point but a wish really. Not many characters were really as interesting as Arthur Fleck or Murray and maybe Penny.", "Joker was great, one of the best DC and comic book movies of all time, had funny some scenes The Arthur Fleck character was amazing, the story was well written,when Arthur became Joker it was really awesome.

So you think it will cause mass violence or people who are messed up to get what? More messed up? Yeah well you should have thought of that crap 50 years ago. And let's just forget about movies like the Shining or Silence of the Lambs. Yeah, The Joker is going to be absolutely detrimental to society, cause shootings, oh no, ban the film - eat my arse. The media is just encouraging people to do something stupid by bringing that sort of drivel to everyone's attention. Not the Joker, the media is far more detrimental to society than anything else. Unfortunately it's impossible to have an entirely objective media entity without bias. Well that rant went on for a while, what was I talking about?", "Ahh yeah, what's great about the film:", "Holy crap Joaquin Pheonix is a bloody legend, his performance as Arthur Fleck in his transition from slightly mentally f***ed dude to majorly mentally f***ed dude (i.e. The Joker) is impeccable. His portrayal of The Joker is definitely on even terms with Heath's, and Heath created the best villain any superhero movie has ever done. Rest In Peace Heath Ledger. The way in which the film connected Arthur to the Wayne family and specifically Bruce by creating a mystery around Arthur's parentage was extemely well done. If only Todd and his crew were willing to connect this Joker to The Batman in later films, because they set the scene for that possibility quite perfectly, unfortunately that notion is all f**kery. Robert Pattinson, surely you can't do anything worse than Affleck or Clooney, but I've seen Twilight. However, I also agree that you could make a really good Bruce Wayne and Batman. See you in 2021.", "Ok, Arthur's laugh was mind-blowing, and the Joker laugh is hard to do well (I've tried); especially if you're going for it at a new angle, Pheonix's laugh both gave me the creeps and made me crack up at certain points during the film. Honestly, that scene where he's watching the stand-up comedy, but he laughs out of time with the audience, and at the most unfunny lines that are only part of the build up to the actual punchline. Bloody hilarious. Yeah, my favourite scene in the movie I reckon. You might say that it was an insignificant scene, but it does a really fine job of depicting Arthur's detachment to other people and society in general.", "The dark humour is crafted expertly. At least I think so; at my cinema I felt like me and my mate were the only ones laughing throughout the film. Everyone else must just have been wonder-struck at how good the film was.  Arthur's dancing is simply sublime, and I'm not kidding; him busting a move in a public bathroom after he just busted the s**t out of three wankers on a train again did an excellent job of exploring his minor psychological issues. What more can I say, oh yeah, hehehe. Dwarf. I was sort of shocked when he killed that dude, Randall, I'm not absolutely sure why in cosideration. But when the Gary couldn't reach the latch, I laughed a bit guiltily. Arthur Fleck: I don\u2019t want you to worry about money, mom.

To make that claim is disingenuous at best. I find it hard to believe that anyone would walk out of this movie and think that Arthur Fleck is a hero. However, the movie dares you to feel empathy for him, and I definitely did. Joker really paints a bleak picture of a society that treats the suffering, mentally ill poor like garbage, and then shows apathy when violence does break out.", "On that note, the violence in this film is not overly gorey, but it is extremely realistic, and this is not a movie for the faint of heart. In addition to the very real violence, this movie is a story of a deeply disturbed man who has an increasingly more terrifying psychotic breakdown over the film's two hour runtime.

This story dares the audience to examine their own treatment of the mentally ill in their lives, and whether or not we really care about them. This movie is brave enough to ask whether our societal apathy is responsible for people going off the deep end and committing gruesome crimes. From a cinematography stand point, the camera work and shot structure is hideously immaculate. It constructs a really dirty, scummy underbelly of a city with striking beauty.", "The soundtrack is great. The music always comes from the world of the movie, and the use of Frank Sinatra is just terrifying to hear. It's very inventive, and I enjoyed pretty much the entire score.", "My only two qualms with the movie are that it is a very, very on-the-nose take on Taxi Driver, and that it is a slow burn.

Who'd have thought of that. Although I'd definitely mention my theory that still stands tall and strong. If a director can make a comedy classic with proper execution then it can pull off any heist of any genres with his eyes closed. Take either Adam McKay or Peter Farelly and now join the co-writer and director Todd Phillips's name to that list. Todd's film is, yes, a recurrent display of what you want from this film. It can also be translated as his fandom of this character over the years, that he has finally brought alive. Either way, whenever the film lands our expectations. Good expectations. The film suffers a lot. The script grows tricky for me, whenever the gaps are filled in with what you and the general perception would perceive and the dots that you know are about to come, and have to be a part of this case until it reaches that crime scene.", "The film is only troubling in those senses. Another issue could be argued would be that the film doesn't clarify or give answers to all the existent and even questionable elements of the film. If it is an origin, then it should answer every corner of the truth. Should it? Should it, really though? For amidst this train of reckless actions, we forget that this is a comic book film.

Joker is in its truest form, with complete make up, dyed hair and colored suit, then becomes a comic book character. The consequences are to be determined. And not the reasons.", "Not the \"whys\", but the \"what now\". And this is why Joker is much more present then Arthur Fleck. When Fleck is lost, the mobile objects in the wide shots are going further and further away. And when Joker shines, those same objects, those same trains returns back home. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck never looks for the surrounding or outside the vehicle he is in, for he has nothing, no one to look for. And Phoenix as Joker giddily drools over the catastrophe that his choices casts on Gotham city, a significance of his presence, existence. Joker is almost too aptly titled. For the film doesn't focus on any other character. You cannot blame that it is an excuse or justification with an emotionally manipulated track. You are empathetic towards him but that is only because he is the only one you have been with. His is the only appeal you have been hearing. The laugh you have been listening.

It's deeply indebted to Alan Moore for this versio of the Joker's origin, and viewers should always remember that there is no 'definitive' Joker, or at least that question won't be settled until DC releases The Three Jokers!

Joker in every essence is a masterpiece. Like every scene is a part of a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces fall right into place, Todd has made sure you see it happening.

I would just say to anyone judging without actually watching, give it a try. If only to see Joaquin Phoenix top Heath Ledger as Joker, which I didn\u2019t think would ever happen after Dark Knight. There was a hell of a lot more substance to this than I expected. This was a masterful slow burning character study, showing the transformation of a downtrodden, mentally ill sociopath, into The Joker. And yeah, it\u2019s one of the darkest and most uncomfortable comedies you will ever see but it\u2019s set up and done very well. Visually great, soundtrack great and Phoenix was unbelievable. This is getting a lot of bad reviews from critics who I guess were made uncomfortable but there are thousands of senselessly violent movies and this was dark as you get, but not senseless. Metacritic currently has an average rating from critics of 57/100, with both the metacritic and imdb users rating it 9.2/10.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["First of all, the message in this film is great especially with what\u2019s going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it\u2019s pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I\u2019m just going to put in my five cents and that\u2019s Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn\u2019t start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won\u2019t get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur\u2019s slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that\u2019s a character story. So, if you don\u2019t want to watch a story about a man who\u2019s driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we\u2019ve seen before, though it\u2019s hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing. In the end, this movie is an amazing character story with an important message."]},

Aside from being masterfully shot, edited, acted and directed, the film is dangerous for all the right reasons. It casts a revealing light against us as a society in 2019 - how we treat each other, brush anything we don\u2019t like or aren\u2019t prepared to deal with under the carpet and most of all how the media and social elites tell us what to think, who to idolise, what we can or can\u2019t like or find funny. The socio-political commentary took me completely by surprise in what is also a fantastic character study of a poor, lonely loser struggling with mental illness -who goes completely ignored through life when he\u2019s not being bullied- and how this person finds less and less reasons to be polite and \u2018put on a happy face\u2019. Arthur is an underdog we all recognise, regardless of our race or gender, and the film raises the question that perhaps we need to look at ourselves closer in how we treat those in less fortunate situations than our own. It\u2019s easy in this age of electronic distractions to adopt an \u2018I\u2019m alright Jack\u2019 attitude, and perhaps it\u2019s this ignorance to the cries for help of others that creates the Jokers of the real world.", "This is the most relevant and important film of our time."]},
{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Films based on comic books have been the craze over the last decade or so, to say the least. From Iron Man launching a franchise bigger than any interconnected cinematic franchise in history to The Dark Knight being known as one of the best films of all time, we're currently living in the golden age of comic book adaptations, so it should come as no surprise that a few unexpected outings would be attempted as well. Joker has now hit theatres and while I can say right off the top that it won't be for all moviegoers, this is a fantastic piece of storytelling. Being alone his entire life and thrown to the side by society, Arthur Fleck still lives with his mother well into adulthood and has a full-time job as a street clown. Having a condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh, this character study is engaging from start to finish. Slowly realizing the truth about his life, things begin to devolve into chaos in his mind. Joker is simply a study of the mind of someone who has nothing left to live for or be happy about. For this reason alone, this is going to be a tough watch for certain viewers. Having a homicidal maniac as your core focus is not exactly an easy sell.  Now, Joker shares quite a few similarities to other classic films, which is being criticized a lot throughout many reviews, but I didn't see that as a negative. There are so many formulas that have been emulated to create great works of fiction that calling this movie a rip-off would be an insult to the filmmakers. On top of that, this movie is held together by a performance by Joaquin Phoenix that's truly out of this world, so any minor issues I had were usually overshadowed by him.  Phoenix's portrayal of this character, like every actor who has played this character in the past, is extremely committed, whether or not you like the outcome. Thankfully, I think his portrayal is completely different from anyone who came before him, making this movie one that will be able to stand on its own for a long time. From his quirks when the film begins to where he ends up during the final act, each and every moment was riveting.  In the end, Joker does borrow a little too much from classic to really call it a masterpiece or perfect, but it's pretty close in my opinion, in terms of holding your interest for an unlikely anti-hero. It's directed very, very well by Todd Phillips and I was more than happy to see him evolve as a filmmaker here. This is something that I never thought I would see him do and, aside from the level of great comedy in a movie like The Hangover, this is probably his best work to date. I loved nearly everything about this movie, even though it will upset some viewers and make them feel very uncomfortable. In fact, for that reason alone, it has done its job very well. You're not supposed to root for him, but rather understand where his actions come from. This is a great film."]},

It\u2019s main business is provocation: making you feel bad for feeling happy, making you feel bad when you feel bad, shocking you with violence and gore and the indignities of being poor and sick and awkward. It hurts to watch Phoenix move. It hurts to watch him walk or dance or laugh. The rictus of pain in which his body is permanently placed. He is at times dainty and fey, then red-hot and blundering, slapdash, improvisational, weak, timid, meek, then conniving and smooth, impossibly suave and impossibly kind, caring, confident, self-possessed, then unhinged. But his swings don\u2019t come off as random or unpredictable: Arthur is unraveling, shedding the his psychic blocks.", "I\u2019m writing this review earlier than the others, because I\u2019m a few (ten) behind, and it seemed like this would be an urgent one for people on the fence. I\u2019ve been following this film for a while now, mostly because of my fascination with Joaquin Phoenix but also because I\u2019ve been waiting for the Suicide Squad/Venom movie I was promised. One that would revel in the amorality of comic book villainy, spend some time in the mud, build the stakes for a confrontation, and push back on the platitudes of 21st century superheroism. That\u2019s not what this is. This is more.", "I can see why someone would walk out. At multiple points. Or call this empty and soulless, void of any soul or moral inspection. In some ways the film feels like a polemic, like something that could be watched totally unironically. But I sort of like that it\u2019s missing its compass, errant, rambling, has that sort of colorless feel of a once-vibrant shirt that\u2019s spent too much time in the wash. Mysteries abound, fake news is unconfirmable, the past is a Gatsbian destination, out of reach. At the same time, it\u2019s tidy: dreams die, lines land, set pieces are constructed, and people end neatly. Phoenix performs performance, rehearsal, the molding of self, the telling of fiction, the face he pulls in that hospital scene is so perfectly gleeful.", "Every moment of sympathy is undercut by our knowledge, our assumption of the end. Every decision is undermined by the murkiness of his decision-making, the chaos of his moral system, and the slow spiral out of control. And what is most exciting is that it does really feel like a new way to tell stories in a genre that has been painting itself into boxes for the last ten, fifteen years. They\u2019ve scraped everything cheerful and fun out of movie and left the husk of a story, the pockmarked battlefield of the present American psyche, what Friend calls, \u201ca time capsule\u201d movie, somewhat in the same intention as The Dead Don\u2019t Die. It feels like a high water mark for dark, mirthless self-seriousness, in a way that seems inimitable, even as it invites comparisons to classics like Taxi Driver and contemporary analogs that were passed up for Oscar attention not too long ago, like First Reformed (2018).", "But even as I mention Ethan Hawke\u2019s performance, there\u2019s something distinctly daring about doing this as a comic book movie, where expectations are so high for such a different brand of humor. Phoenix\u2019s portrayal finally makes Heath Ledger\u2019s performance feel cartoonish where it used to seem dark and threatening. Ledger\u2019s Joker was a talker, his terror was psychological, but Pheonix\u2019s is bottled up, repressed, his terror is social, cultural.", "Joker is a movie for people who like movies but hate superhero movies.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["jWhen Warner Bros first tried to make their DCEU it got off to a rocky start with some of their films struggling to find their own voice. Mostly since a lot of what they were doing was just trying to copy Marvel, ranging from an attempt at their own Guardians of the Galaxy with Suicide Squad or hiring Avengers scribe Joss Whedon to finish filming of the Justice League. But finally it seems DC has found its footing by focusing less on an extended universe and more on just making good standalone movies with tones playing to the strengths of their characters. We saw it earlier this year with the wholesomely hilarious Shazam and we\u2019re definitely seeing it here with a film that completely upends all of our expectations for the comic book genre through Joker, a character drama which completely reinvents of DC\u2019s most iconic villains.", "Taking place in a 70s version of Gotham (albeit a version of Gotham which looks strikingly similar to a 70s New York) the film follows Arthur Flecks descent into becoming the Joker. When we first meet him he\u2019s already in a bad position. He\u2019s stuck in a dead end job as a part time clown, caring for his frail mother in a rundown apartment, he\u2019s taking seven different drugs to deal with his depression and keeps bursting into uncontrollable fits of laughter to the point where he\u2019s in physical pain. Basically he\u2019s just one bad day from complete lunacy and it seems that life is constantly beating him down to give him that one last push over the edge.", "Even the few lifelines that Arthur does have to his sanity seem to be brutally slashed over the course of the film, with many actions completely outside of Arthur\u2019s control such as cuts to social care further isolating him from society. Bus riders treat him with disdain, kids beat him down in the street and we even get an interesting portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a snobby rich guy completely detached from the real problems faced by society. Though the way that almost every character in the city is completely unsympathetic is arguably done to a fault, as many characters in the film do end up being one dimensional characters with the sole goal of furthering Arthur\u2019s descent. Though in showing us Arthur\u2019s descent, Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the greatest performances of the year so far. The Joker has so many great portrayals, ranging from the pure chaos of Heath Ledger to the comically homicidal showmanship of Mark Hamil, but Phoenix has still found his own way to leave a mark on the character by layering him with a sense of tragedy as we see the pain that goes towards creating a maniac. It\u2019s one of those incredible performances where the transformation is so fluid, but so monumental that we go from sympathising with a man beaten down by a cruel system to terrified at a madman capable of tearing a city down. There are so many small touches that really stood out to me like Joaquin\u2019s slow transformation from self hatred in to turning his anger on to those around him and that laugh which constantly sounds as if he\u2019s about to burst in to tears. Though the part of his performance that struck me the most was the extreme weight loss Joaquin underwent to portray the Joker. Beyond giving us an interesting insight in to his self-harming nature at the start of the film, there\u2019s a level of visual discomfort whenever he\u2019s on screen in a similar way to Chritian Bale in The Machinist. Beyond seeing his unnaturally frail boney structure, Joaquin said that the extreme weight loss gave him a sense of fluidity throughout the film which really showed throughout the film as Phoenix always appeared to move with such an unnatural liveliness. Some of the films most striking moments are some dancing sequences scattered throughout the film where the Jokers homicidal nature starts to peak out with as his rhythm begins to match up with the films haunting score.  It\u2019s somewhat ironic that the film received so many criticisms for its sympathetic portrayal of a psychopath given that the same criticisms were previously thrown at the films like Fight Club and Taxi Driver that influenced it. Regardless, it\u2019s important to realise that at no point does this film ever glorify violence. And the film does get us to empathise with the pain that Arthur goes through during the film, however it never condones his actions. A lot of credit needs to go to Warner Bros for being willing to provide such free roam to create such a chilling vision of one of their most valuable characters. And even more credit needs to go to Todd Phillips himself, who spent a year campaigning to get his r-rated character study off the ground at a time when action spectacles dominate the screens. Whilst he does cover similar ground to the Scorsese films that inspired him, this isn\u2019t just a carbon copy and he really brought a unique vision to the Joker. I just hope that following this films success, Warner Bros continues to experiment with the rest of DC\u2019s pantheon."]},

Joker easily became one of my most anticipated films of 2019. I understood that it was taking a different approach, doing it's own thing outside of the Extended DC Universe. Reality can be a cruel mistress, along with life not being all sunshine and rainbows. It's unfortunate and sometimes we need movies to help us see that things can get crazier, it's unsettling though brutally beautiful there's no denying that. I'm not glorifying violence, though unfortunately when society, and communities fall. It's bound to happen, it's not going to be a light subject. It's going to be dark, grim, and dirty. Each kill or violent act we can see the madness growing until it reaches it's crescendo. To see the journey towards madness unfold with every inconvenience, every emotional breakdown it's heartbreaking, unpleasant, and it just makes you feel unnerved. Those aren't exactly bad traits for the performances just sell it. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a hauntingly painful display, we can see a broken man just scatter and rebuild into something more sinister. When all hope is lost, what more do you have to give? Zazie Beets as Sophie also did a great job with her role, acting as one of the few hope spots for poor Arthur, and De Niro playing a talk show host who might be a slimeball for his ridicule is no slouch either."]},

So as someone who went in with next to no expectations, only a rudimentary knowledge of the background discussion, and a healthy distrust of many of DC's more recent film offerings, what did I think?", "I think \"Joker\" is most-definitely a good film, but not a great one, all down to one fatal flaw. It unfortunately never stops leaping for that mystical \"higher bar\", the legendary status enjoyed by films like The Dark Knight, and in that eagerness overreaches and kills its true potential. At its most sincere, \"Joker\" succeeds in being a convincingly fiery crucible to forge such a legendary villain, but especially in the beginning, turns up the heat even more to the point of self-parody.", "When we're first dropped onto the dismal-yet-familiar streets of Gotham, the film wastes no time in setting the world against Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, and that over-eagerness was my core issue. There's no buildup, no hope, no sense of potential wasted: Without any world-building or context, Fleck existing just to get beaten down and beaten down is shockingly ineffective, proving the film's priorities are focused on the goal, rather than the beginning. Gangs of bullies and ruthless bosses feel more forced than villainous, transparent mechanisms that exist solely to get the character where he needs to be, rather than to provide the organic descent and societal backdrop we were promised. It feels shallow, and in essence, the film would've benefited from taking its foot of the accelerator for a moment and smelling the roses, because as it stands, \"Joker\" starts off doing 90 mph in a fifty, and hits you with all the subtlety and depth of a freight train.", "However, once the wheels are in motion and Fleck's descent begins, director Todd Phillips and Phoenix are more able to run wild, and this is where the film truly shines. After a shaky opening, the ensuing roller-coaster ride is truly a sight to behold. And why wouldn't it be? Hasn't the Joker always been more effective in the present, did Heath Ledger need a backstory to succeed? No! As we watch both Gotham and Fleck unravel, every revelation and every depraved act comes as a gut-punch, all building up to a live finale that perfectly fits the tone of the film while feeling authentically Joker, and an ending that wisely avoids the expected cliches and ends on a note of glee. Here, the Joker becomes a twisted hero in his own way. It wasn't the success Arthur Fleck had hoped for, but it feels like destiny nonetheless, and by the end all force and stiffness from the start of \"Joker's\" world fades away into a feeling of chilling plausibility.", "So to conclude, I would recommend \"Joker\" for anyone looking for a fresh take on the classic character. This isn't your typical superhero flick, and while the darkness and violence may be a turn-off for some, it's an experience most will enjoy. It's a film that starts off unconvincingly, but is sure to leave an impact by the end. And with such large clown-shoes to fill, \"Joker\" more or less reaches the bar."]},

I didn't want all the press and early reviews to cloud my judgment on what I PERSONALLY thought of the film. So after seeing it, what do I think? I believe the hype. It's a true modern day masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets and none of the hate from naysayers. Phoenix gives a performance that rivals Ledger's and brings something never before seen to the comic book world. Todd Phillips has proven that he no longer needs the frat-boy comedies and that the world of dramas is where he thrives best. Lawrence Sharr, the man behind the cinematography, has brought to life some of the most gorgeous shots I have ever personally seen, even rivaling Roger Deakins from Blade Runner 2049. The score by Hildur is ecstatic and terrifying to listen to. I really love this movie, from its story -- while familiar -- fits within the world that has been established, to the acting FROM EVERYBODY, to the greater themes of bad days, society, and madness itself. It's sad to say that we will never get another look into the world of Joker because this movie left me wanting more, and that's a truly amazing thing for a movie to do. If it leaves you wanting more, then it did its job. Joker is a masterpiece, a true statement on the culture of cinema, and I hope that everyone who receives a nomination wins it, because this movie deserves it.

And that is where the movie shines; everything related to Arthur is pretty good but once he slowly starts turning into the Joker it starts falling apart.The attempt to ground this movie in the Gotham mythos is what keeps it from being anything else than an above average one as there are many inconsistencies with the source material, rangig from the superficial, like the age difference between Bruce and the Arthur(judging by the timeline of the movie, the Joker will walk with a cane by the time Bruce starts kicking ass), to more profound ones, like the fact that this Joker doesn't really resemble the Clown Prince of Crime.

Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times! .", ".", "Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker. .", ".", "Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time. .", ".", "My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total f**king bulls**t. .", ".", "Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold. .", ".", "Rating:", "Score : 10/10", "Grade : A+"]},

I consider Ledger's Joker a bit more sadistic, but that's only because now we know one vision of where Joker came from. The most fun aspect of the character is that you can play him any way you want and it's still correct.

It is as perfect a film, in its genre, as The Godfather, or Schindler's List, or Casablanca, or Lawrence of Arabia. The professional critics, the ones who get paid by major newspapers to say how much they hate a movie, most of them despise this one because it appears to be a social commentary on what a mentally ill loner will do if society pushes him too far. Many critics call it dangerous and incendiary because it may incite some - well, mentally ill loner out there - to do what he sees Joker do in the movie.", "Guess what, critics? You're right. It is incendiary. Because it tells the truth. Unflinchingly. Without euphemisms. Anyone who hates this movie as a social commentary is probably part of the problem our society has right now. At least in America, mental disorders and diseases are spurned by those who don't have them as not real medical problems. This isn't true. The film sympathizes with Fleck for a good reason: if society had treated him better, he wouldn't have become the most evil monster in the history of comic book literature.", "That movie critics are writing such vituperative reviews of the film only proves the film's point: those critics hate it because it holds up a mirror to nature and forces them to confront their hatred of the truth of reality.", "Because of the controversy I can't predict its Oscar chances, but I believe they're good. Phoenix is genuinely unnerving in every single scene and the intensity gets tighter and tighter toward the end until it becomes absolutely unbearable during the scene on the Murray Franklin Show when Joker appears as a guest. De Niro may also deserve an Oscar nod. He supports the lead performance with perfect experience.", "How do I summarize such a masterpiece? If I had to use only one word, I think I'd say \"devastating.\" But there's more to it than that. It's equal parts gritty crime drama, comic book movie, horror movie, and tear-jerker. At the end, when Joker is in Arkham Asylum running from the guards, everything is white and it reminds you of A Clockwork Orange. The whole film is inspired by Taxi Driver.", "Those who call it \"too dark, too violent and bloody\" must not have understood what they were getting into when buying a ticket to see any kind of film about the Joker character. He's dark and violent in the comic books. We live in an age of PG-13, which permits a larger audience and thus more money, but this film is no bloodier or violent than the average nasty action movie from the '80s and early '90s. The body count is about 10, most of them Joker's victims. The difference is that the violence hits hard! If you can stomach Saving Private Ryan or The Passion of the Christ, this film's violence is a walk in the park.", "You will leave the theater feeling devastated, overwhelmed by its magnificence, and yes, you'll feel inspired, but not to commit acts of violence. The critics don't seem to understand. This film does not glorify mental illness or the online \"incel\" community. It doesn't just try to speak to the latent anger of lonely, anti-social white guys who really need to vent their anger and frustration. It tells the entire world the following, very simple statement: the mentally ill need to be helped, loved, hugged, encouraged to seek treatment, be it medication or therapeutic conversations. They need to be shown in some way that there's no shame in being mentally ill. The only shame is in not seeking help.", "At the end, Joker tells Murray Franklin, on live TV, \"What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? I'll tell you what you get! You get what you **** deserve!\" Then he blows Franklin's brains out.", "It's unfortunate. It's painful and deplorable to look at. But Fleck is right. The writers and actors are right. In real life that is exactly what you get."]},

That purpose/message that we can understand from the movie isn't just the violence or the fight against the richest searching for a more fair world; the message goes beyond that, exploring the hard life (of mentally ill) and making us reflect about how we (you, me, everybody) treat those that are different to us in a world that falls piece by piece (not so different to ours). The violence and the fights were a consequence of that, but the origin is in the real treat with people.

Or perhaps he is a fair man unjustly persecuted by a delusional former employee, with high morale standards and an agenda to fight corruption and bring social reform to Gotham. Joker goes out of its way to ensure that you can never truly know which permutation of these traits is real, and leaves the viewer as sole arbiter of their personal truth", "The film piles these ambiguities decadently and aggressively, and at face value without subtlety, however I feel that the smartest aspect of the film is the careful balance and layering of these competing value judgements in a manner that seems to have confounded the critics. I have read many reviews decrying the lack of political and morale stance from the filmmakers, but I truly believe that this was a deliberate attempt by the creators to make a movie where the viewer is free to construct their own morale narrative.", "The main character Arthur Fleck brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix treats life with disdain, chain smoking his way through a miserable existence and deteriorating mental state with a slowly building anger and latterly a sense of empowerment through violence. Despite this he provides very little verbal exposition for his deeds allowing the viewer to project motive and ultimately judgement on his character.", "The multitude of narrative and morale ambiguities in the movie mean that by the conclusion each viewer has experienced their own personal Joker who largely reflects their own experience and worldview in a manner that few other stories have achieved. There exist infinitely as many Jokers as viewers, and fittingly this idea is visualised in the film with the proliferation of clowns as the film progresses.", "I believe that this is truly groundbreaking  storytelling combined with exemplary cinematography and that Joker will stand the test of time."]},

Anyways , this movie was an amalgamation of emotions stirred up for a person I didn\u2019t think I ever cared for , aside from being a badass in a previous portrayal by Heath. Let\u2019s put this to rest right now ; Joaquin\u2019s Joker was so real to the point that I connected on a more personal level (than previous jokers including heaths) and I can see authenticity in this joker being THE joker that eventually faces off with Bats - even in this \u201cdepressing\u201d formative period of his .... despite being exposed to an action packed super intelligent Heath Joker years before this . The feeling of powerlessness and a world against you is really what gets you down through your first 40 minutes or so in the movie but it\u2019s not a depressingly down feeling it\u2019s more of a contemplatively-down feeling for Arthur\u2019s condition and his situation in life . Essentially , it\u2019s hard to NOT feel for Arthur as opposed to what previous movies would conjure up in us for the joker - which always painted him as a one sided villain as opposed to the complex more than human Joker we see in this film.", "Overall the scenes were shot so well I felt like I was watching an old movie, which also helped complete the feeling of taxi driver (also that revolver Joker gets seems like a snubbed version of it), but also gave the setting of the film a perfect alibi - this WAS INDEED the time before Batman ; and we can tell from the scenery , the outfits and the props ... very well done.", "I feel although there\u2019s no promise of a sequel , the director and cast HAS to deliver a sequel - as the roller coaster ride of this journey has just begun and they really pulled the tempo of the film off correctly as to really entice us to be hungry for more screen time of Arthur In his very earliest joker years .", "If I could , I would see this made into a tv series as it seems so realistic with the way it displayed this joker , and the action was spread out enough to create suspense and many other emotions . If this was done I would expect them to cast Joaquin , due to his great performance , or at least someone that can emulate his exact performance and demeanor - as this was a performance I didn\u2019t expect to \u201cattract\u201d me so much as it did .", "Great film , 10/10 for me - if it weren\u2019t for the critics mindlessly bashing this title I wouldn\u2019t have written this review , but I feel like this is something we need to speak up about because everyone seeing this film either really likes it or LOVES it - BESIDES the critics ... hmmm I wonder why ? Maybe it has something to do with the AGENDA of those that wish to push a specific NARRATIVE for their platform? Look that\u2019s fine and all but please be a bit more transparent with your bias if you choose to run a review website . Compare the critics to the user reviews , how many of each one and you will see who the liars are and who is telling the truth about the movie . Everythings an \u201copinion\u201d they will say after slanging dirt in an untruthful review ... ok that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t go bashing something that was shot , edited , directed , and written WELL and try to pretend like it\u2019s just some unbiased opinion, we can see through that ! I, like thousands of others , went into the film UNBIASED and loved it , do the same and you will too ; go in there thinking the movie will have your incel neighbor boy kill you , you will leave there confused just to go on your critic profile on meta critic and bash for no reason and that will guarantee you have a bad time under the guise of social semantics ."]},

Well now imagine if that kid grows up, becomes a clown while having mental problems, and the city is going through a recess of sorts that cuts the funding of his social worker that prescribes his anti-depressive medication!

For the message of this film is monsters are rarely born, but created by other monsters. A statement which is very true in the world we live in. And yet still while making this point the film still successfully falls short of trying to justify any of his horrible actions he makes later as the joker. While at first it seems like a very straight forward narrative. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear that there is a lot more going on as it draws inspiration from some very prominent graphic novels such as The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, and I do feel a second viewing may be required. Being set around the late 70s/early 80s, the film is made to look, though a combination of camera angles and colour palettes very much like films made in that era with a soundtrack to suit. It even intentionally parodies key films from that era, the 2 obvious ones being Taxi Driver and King of Comedy with Robert De Niro being cast as a very clear homage. Reasons for such parodies become clear upon the completion of the film.", "The standout feature of this film is Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which is comparable to but still distinguished from Heath Ledgers Joker. I still don't know which one I prefer or if I prefer one over the other, as both work perfectly within their own films and I think can both sit at the top next to each other for their own reasons. Early on in the film there is a very specific and brilliant character trait revealed about Joaquin's character Arthur Fleck which completely alters the context of all his self expressions throughout the film.", "Personally I think this film is best viewed as a very black comedy. And while it is probably not the best film made this year, it is still a very good film and is exactly what you want in a Joker movie, so from me gets 8/10", "P.S. anyone going into this film expecting an incel hero worship narrative as promised in various articles online, you will not find that here, unless you go in completely ignorant of what is presented in front of you"]},

Arthur is white, male, mentally ill, has become misanthropic due to feeling that society has abused and abandoned him, and seeks attention from committing atrocities, all of which are common traits among today\u2019s spree killers. The film is not an endorsement of violence, but an exploration of the mindset of a killer. The film is very melodramatic, but that isn\u2019t a bad thing. Each incident that pushes Arthur further into evil is reminiscent of situations that inspire real life violence, not to endorse the violent acts, but to explain the motives behind them.

Joker takes this further by distancing itself from the entire superhero genre. In fact, the only reason that this is a superhero movie are a few place and character names that could\u2019ve been changed without impacting the plot, but as nice as it would be, a major studio would never put so much money and effort into a film like this unless it was tied to a lucrative franchise like DC/Batman. I\u2019ve previously said that Black Panther is the only superhero film that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar other than Best Visual Effects, but I believe that not only does Joker also deserve to be nominated in several Oscar categories, it possibly even deserves to win them.

If anything, it's a Scorsesian roundup in which minor works are often better than major ones, and Todd Phillips is adept at paying homage also to the first ones, from the sequences on the stairs of \"New York, New York\" (1977) to the ambulances of \"Bringing Out the Dead\" (1999). It's a film that flows fast, but that is so much a merit as a defect: for example, there is no serious deepening of the (bidirectional?) link between psychic discomfort and social unease, a \"praise of folly\" more exhibited than explained, or of the problematic integration of subjectivity into the Warholian world of entertainment (and in fact the failed seminarian dedicated an entire film to each of these aspects).

The movie excels on telling a story about a slowly growing psychopath that gets where he is due to the society rejecting him, by showing it oppress Joker in a lot of ways that, while we don't agree at all with what he does at the end of the movie, we can't stop but feel sorry about him and even understand him a little. Speaking of the Joker, holy s*it, Joaquim Phoenix nailed on the role of the character! He managed to show us how a mentally ill man behaves without getting too much exaggerated to sound forced, he managed to give to us a brand new version of the character, which I enjoy WAY more than the original one, and it rivals with Robert Downey Jr to be the best actor to portray a comic book character until now. The direction is pretty solid, without any points where the quality of it decreases but without any highlights, and the soundtrack is really good. There are only two problems with the movie, the first being the guy that runs the television show, what he does during the movie doesn't make so much sense and it gets a bit ridiculous, I know that he is egocentric and all but that was simply way to unrealistic for me to ignore. The second one is that, despite Joaquim amazing performance, Arthur was not the most charismatic I have seen in a movie, outside of all the suffering and madness he goes through, I can't find much more character identity on him, we never saw him outside of an endless wheel of suffering that, I must admit, while good, started to get me tired on the last third of the movie. With that being said, the qualities overthrow the flaws, and the movie is really good, I just think while he performs everything very well, he excels at nothing outside Joaquim performance, and those two problems I stated previously really stop him from being a masterpiece, but he is worth your time. 8.5/10 Best DC movie."]},

Still, can't find the subtlety the theme needs to find truth and dimension on the character construction.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["So I finally saw the joker, and it didn't really surprise me. I expected it to appeal to a certain demographic, and it absolutely does. Phoenix's performance is stellar, which I expected given past performances in The Master and You Were Never Really Here, but the plot was predictable. I get it, it's an origin story, but if you stack it up against Ledger's performance, I don't like this Joker at all. It's Taxi Driver if Travis Bickle were a victim of abuse and overt mental illness. It mirrors that movie in many ways, but one thing I'll say for Travis, we didn't have to set him up as this ultimate victim. Unlike Ledger's Joker, a sociopath who would have made this Joker's past a lie to feign victimhood, throwing off his adversaries, Phoenix's Joker is a victim. He's a man with no agency who finds it in a gun. It's the dream of every incel and nutjob who's ever felt they were given a raw deal and finally snapped into a beautiful swan song of violence and retribution. What's truly terrifying about the joker is the mob. Much like Antifa or the alt-right today, the mob is looking for any excuse to be a mob, and they look to this broken man who's only claim to fame is shooting unarmed people (granted, the first time is in defense). It's as if the entire population of disaffected white 20-somethings rallied around Dylan Roof or the guy who shot up the theater in Colorado. Again, Phoenix's performance is legendary and he dives into this character. He is Arthur Fleck, who is a more interesting character to me than the Joker. I don't know if that was the intent of the film, but it kind of undercuts the agency of superheroes/villains. You don't walk away from Joker hating the bad guy. Many walk away on his side. On the side of the mob, where it's far easier to protest and react violently in the face of adversity than it is to actually do the hard work of fixing problems or people. It's the lazy internet route to social change that leaves the same problems covered in a layer of poopy pants that no one realizes how special someone is. In fact, you could rename this Travis Bickle's Afterbirth."]},

I am a sucker for 'flawed narrative', where the star has denial which colors the facts of the movie (the best example id The Sixth Sense, 2nd best is the old silent movie The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari).  The director also made the Hangover series, of which the first one is excellent (mostly due to Mike Tyson and Bradley Cooper), this puts him in a whole other league, like Scorsese light. The cinematographer also did career best work here, everything looks like its inside an aquarium with beautiful muted greens and no primary colors anywhere.  This movie grossed almost $1b, an amazing feat in the time of cgi sequels, a real testament to the character and work of everyone involved.

The film is able to walk that line (pun not intended) between offering a commentary on our own society and that of portraying a notorious maniac that has endured as one of the best foils and villains in pop culture to date. In fact it's a testament to how well executed this film is that you only are given the slightest connection to the greater Batman canon. Joker has always been more compelling as a psychological villain and we see that transformation unfold on screen. Due to Phoenix's excellent performance the film stands on it's own as one of the best adaptations of a comic book character. Whether you prefer Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger or Joqauin Phoenix? Each actor has offered their own take on the devious clown prince of crime and they all still are fantastic in their own right."]},

I\u2019ve had the opportunity to watch it twice now, which if you haven\u2019t, you should. Todd Phillips did an outstanding job directing this film, to my surprise. I watched a video where he said that he had the musical composer read the screenplay and make the music based off of that alone. Phillips then made the scenes with the influence from the music, letting the acting and the tone to go with it as well. Genius. Don\u2019t even get me started on Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance. Phenomenal. He is so enticing and believable when he plays Arthur Fleck, from his walking/ mannerisms to the way he laughs. One big thing of previous actors who have portrayed the Joker is to have their own flavor when it comes the \u201cJoker\u2019s laugh\u201d. Joaquin took a more natural and painful laugh with Arthur having Pseudo-bulbar Affect and not being able to control his laughter, even in awkward situations. The fact you can see the pain in his eyes even when he\u2019s uncontrollably laughing just shows how outstanding of an actor Joaquin is. Even though Arthur gets most of the screen time in a movie about him (lol), all the other side characters still feel extremely real. One thing that I\u2019ve come to appreciate a lot about this film and about Todd Phillips, is that it\u2019s not afraid to make you uncomfortable. It makes you question if it\u2019s alright to have sympathy for a psychopath. It shows what can happen when the government and others choose to ignore the mentally ill, and just think nothing of those that it affects. Overall an outstanding movie, I suggest anyone that hasn\u2019t seen it in theaters yet to go watch it! I know I\u2019ll go a few more times!"]},

The reviews are highly polarised.  Before I heard people saying that you will either really love the Joker, or really hate it. As someone who has been looking forward to the film ever since seeing the first trailer, finally yesterday I made my journey to the cinema and had a taste of the actual film. Well, in the end, I neither really love it nor hate it. If I have to describe my feeling, I would probably say\u2026disappointed. So what is the Joker about? To sum up, it is a story about the absurdism of life, the death of hope, the absence of meaning, moral nihilism, political anarchy, and a celebration of chaos expressed and executed in an ultimate aesthetic ways via cinematic languages along with some of the most oppressive music I\u2019ve heard in recent films. Much of these themes, if not all, reflect the fatal problematics of our post-modernist societies and cultures who envision the contemporary world as \u201can age of spiritual deficiency.\u201d  I don\u2019t have any problems with films with a realist stand trying to explore the downfalls of our culture, society, and complexity of humanities. Actually I think that this is what good cinema should do. My problem with the Joker is exactly that it didn\u2019t do any of these. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I still think the Joker is a great art. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s acting is absolutely fantastic, the music and cinematography breathtaking. But it\u2019s still poor character-writing in which the complexity of humanity is reduced to its pitiful negativities, as in the Joker, everyone is sick, mean and evil. The ones who see or believe in something good in life are either insane (Arthur\u2019s mother and Arthur himself) or hypocritical (the upper-class men). The former was ridiculed and labeled funny, the latter only harvested social grudge. It is a sad movie. What is even sadder is the media sensation around the movie. Before the movie was marketed as an antithesis of the mainstream commercial films in the superhero genre. It is meant to be a \u201csub-culture,\u201d a non-commercial thing. But ironically, look at it now! It is very much MAINSTREAM. Chatting with a friend who lamented over \u201cthe degradation of contemporary culture,\u201d I also can\u2019t stop thinking\u2014what kind of society are we living in? What kind of mentality do our mass viewers have in order to \u201cenjoy\u201d and even \u201cempathize\u201d with such a depressing film? To give a final remark, I think the Joker is, although probably against its own will, a successful commercial popcorn movie, because there is no much there beyond the overwhelming sensual experience it evokes. Nevertheless, if one does think it is in any way different and more special than other commercial popcorn films, it is special only because it makes you feel so uneasy that you could hardly swallow any popcorns while watching it."]},

The acting would be top level and the feel and pace of the movie would have been perfect. Phoenix's portrayal is fantastic and is at times purposely cringe worthy watching. That being said I had went to watch a portrayal of Batmans arch nemesis The Joker. This was not even close to the character, he wasnt smart, in fact he appeared to have a learning difficulty, he was in no way close to the Joker of the comic franchise.  As for the Batman timeline, the movie made no sense at all. It portrayed Bruce Wayne as 10 yrs old and Joker as approx 40yrs old.  Joker shud be retiring when Batman gets going.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["An interesting film to think about and worth watching for the cultural factor alone. We know that Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is the Joker and this is his origin film so I won't talk about the outline of the plot in chronological order. The club scenes where he is laughing at the wrong times and he cannot tell his own jokes later on for his uncontrollable laughter are some of the most compelling scenes in the film. The production values were all good as you would expect from a big studio picture. I liked the approach of making the film darker and grittier than your standard comic book movie, you really felt as if Gotham was this volcanic cesspit ready to erupt. The buildup of the revolution with the talk of garbage everywhere and the government closing Arthur's program down and cutting his medication, his 'crazy' mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy), this makes the altercation on the train where he kills the guys all the more understandable and real. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) calling the lower class clowns, I can see an outcry but this definitely felt overblown for me with how they then viewed the subway killings and this clown figure which is Arthur as some messiah for them to follow and rebel against the upper class. I did like how Thomas Wayne appeared less like this benevolent god as he is always seemingly portrayed though.", "However, the film felt very predictable and soulless for me. I didn't believe that Arthur and Thomas Wayne were related because his mother was obviously mentally disturbed and Frances Conroy is the stereotypical unstable or strange woman (Six Feet Under' and 'American Horror Story'). There was every chance they were related however with the inscription on the back of the photo of Penny by \"T.W\", either way the question becomes irrelavant because we know Arthur is an unreliable narrator and his path has been set because it is a film about the Joker's origins so it had to be this way. The worst parts of the movie were with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) but not because of her perfromance, she performed as well as anyone in the film, it was a solid ensemble performance but she was let down with a poor screenplay as were the rest of the cast. They showed Arthur was delusional before his encounters with Sophie and you are expected to believe they embrace in her doorway and after his laughing fit at the comedy club, she is seen a short while after laughing with him? It was far too obvious. but it is meant to be a big revelation that he imagined it, of course he did, he is a creep.", "The biggest thing for me is I felt as if I was watching some 'Taxi Driver'-'The King of Comedy' mish mash to the point where it was not its own film for me. I thought the whole time that I would rather be watching those films and whilst I largely liked the final act, it was again so obvious that Arthur was going to kill Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) to the point where I lost interest almost completely and I was not overwhelmed by some euphoric cinematic cruscendo of a moment when it happened, because it was typical. Arthur gets his chaos anyway and it is a decent character arc, they should have ended the film with the scene before Arthur is running around the corridors because where Arthur says something along the lines of \"You wouldn't get it\" in the room with the woman and then the song comes on, that was the perfect time to end it, that was very good. I had mixed feelings on showing Bruce Wayne's (Dante Pereira-Olson) parents being killed, simply because I have seen it so many times but I guess it was an alright idea to connect it to Arthur's character arc. I don't think Joker needed an origin film and this should be a mystery aka 'The Dark Knight', this is not to say I went into the film with an automatic disliking for the film because the film did have its merits and I love to keep an open mind to every film obviously, I just did not see the point of this film before going in and I largely feel the same after seeing the film. 'Logan' did for me what this film could not, a dark comic book film that felt like it was its own thing. I do not think I could give it more than a six being truthful, it does not resonate with me but its foundations are solid. I would forget the hype it has got but I would also especially forget the people criticising the violence. There are more violent films that have been made and that will be made, it is 2019 and we do not need the incessant attempts by people in the media industry who are saying that forms of media, e.g. Video Games, Films, TV shows, Podcasts and so on are directly responsible for every violent or illegal act committed.

I fear that the high reviews for some people on here are solely based on the acting or on it's message, or just reactionary because of criticisms the movie has received\u2014and I think these are flawed measurements. What are its merits and deficiencies? First of all, the acting is excellent. Joaquin Phoenix is a favorite actor of mine and he does not disappoint! I am amazed that he can capture a character so well. His portrayal of the Joker is brilliant. The Joker is sad and disturbing. At different times of the movie, you feel tremendous empathy for the Joker\u2014clearly he's gotten a rotten deal out of life and is deeply troubled\u2014and at other times, he's terrifying. Less impressive...The movie is kind of slow moving, but never boring, at least to me. As has been said by the director and others, this movie is not your typical \"comic book\" movie\u2014if you go into it expecting lots of actions, bombs, shootings, car chases, etc\u2014you will be disappointed. (I actually appreciated that about the movie!) There is some of that, but this is by far, more of a drama with very little humor at all. Also, it's not a feel-good drama, the kind that you will want to see again and again. Now in terms of what I think was missing in the movie...the so called \"climatic, shocking, surprising ending\" was predictable. To me, the ending had only two real possibilities and the one I suspected is actually what happened. The ending was the low point of Joker; it began to break down into predictable patterns when I listened to the conversation between Joker and character Murray Franklin. It mostly sounded like the typical diatribe you find on a liberal college campus these days. The world has been unfair to Joker and therefore Joker will get even with the world. And the subtle message is that his violence and terrorism is a bit justifiable\u2014finally the \"weak and ignored\" get their revenge. It also turns the whole Batman story on its head\u2014it makes Joker out to be the hero and Thomas Wayne (and all the rich and powerful) to be the villains and jerks of society. Certainly this is true of some rich and powerful people in our world, but it's this kind of broad brush approach that frustrates me in a movie and the message ends up sounding like a Bernie Sander's campaign speech (no offense intended to Bernie or his supporters). The ending had the potential to be something different, something unconventional\u2014even ambiguous would have been good.  (An illustration of what I mean from the Joker in the \"The Dark Knight\" movie: \"Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just... do things.\" It was that frustrating ambiguity that made the Joker so interesting in The Dark Knight. He was evil to his core and we didn't need to feel sorry for him and we didn't need a justification for his insanity. The message: some people are just evil, without explanation. But in the movie, Joker, at its core, it sounded like a version of the same old retread theme we've been getting these days in shows and movies. All in all, not a bad movie, but I would say, save your money and rent it online cheaper when it comes out soon."]},

Phillips and Scott Silver\u2019s script give Phoenix very little to do other than riff on a psychological tick for two hours.", "Arthur Fleck is a mental illness cliche. Abused, medicated and neurotic. There is no arc for Fleck. Fleck lurches from one unfortunate circumstance to another. There\u2019s no growth, no descent into madness \u2013 just an already poor, disturbed, delusional Arthur. We are never given any reason to empathize with Fleck. An excellent counterpoint to this character is another Phoenix played, Theodore Twombly in Spike Jonze\u2019s superior Her (2013). Twombly is equally marginalized like Fleck, but Jonze and Phoenix give us little glimpses of the character\u2019s humanity in the midst of his existential horror. We never get those in Joker. We, like Arthur, receive unsatisfactory reveals with epic portent and paltry emotional punch.", "Joker also lacks unifying tonal elements. Phillips can\u2019t seem to decide if Joker is a moody, introspective independent character study or if it wants to wax epic. A solo cello pervades throughout the score, but at key moments Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir seems to dial it up to full Zimmer. The production design is as anachronistic and as disjointed as the score. Everything feels dressed up, the elements are there but the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is missing. This world is too much our own. Joker is one of those rare pictures where the sum of its parts don\u2019t equal the whole. I couldn\u2019t help but think, why wasn\u2019t it shot on film stock using vintage lenses? Though there is not much CGI, Joker is very crisp, very digital and that works against it.", "One thing that does work is the vintage music. One can imagine the creative possibilities of what wanted to be a lyrical, musical picture edited around classic songs. That was a glaringly missed opportunity.", "Zazie Beetz is all but an afterthought in this picture, a wasted talent and a virtual plot device.", "Phillips\u2019 Coup de Gras in this disjointed ramble through mental illness mythology is an equally disjointed monologue at the end. I\u2019ll not spoil it, but it\u2019s a cheap, self conscious, point blank expository shot at society. There\u2019s no teeth to it, it\u2019s not menacing at all.   It\u2019s banal and abrupt.  For those that wish or worry that this film will be the Anarchist, Alt-Right or Incel manifesto \u2026 don\u2019t. This film just isn\u2019t that smart or that creative. There\u2019s a denouement, but there\u2019s not much to it other than cinematic padding.", "If you pay close attention, you\u2019ll see little homages to The King of Comedy, The Dark Knight, Psycho and Network. They\u2019re not egregiously plagiaristic, just flair for the sake of flair. The Era of Easter Eggs needs to end.", "On the up side, the 20 minutes of trailers prior to Joker was exciting. A breath of fresh, serious cinematic air after a long hot Summer of Spandex.", "On a scale of 5, I give Joker a 2.75 and charitably round it up to 3.", "I\u2019d wait for a $2.99 Amazon Prime rental for this one, folks.

This trash-strewn Gotham City of 1981 invokes a dirty, grimier period of cinema and city. In that end, Lawrence Sher\u2019s cinematography nails the feel of the films the movies desperately wants to emulate. It\u2019s far away from the cheery and essentially light MCU  and it\u2019s more dour than the much maligned other DC films, none of which really connect to Joker. This is fine. This is still Batman\u2019s world, but not any version seen previously. In case you thought this stand on its own, there are many direct connections, all forced and inspiring everything from a \u201creally\u201d look to my eyes rolling hard.", "Joker aka Arthur Fleck has no power in life except accidentally starting a revolution with shooting three Yuppies in self-defense. Stripping away the theatricality of the Clown to attempt to present a story of that One Bad Day that made the villain is a refreshing take. But, It is rather unnecessary. It\u2019s been said that Joker is what it would look like if Scorsese tried his hand at a comic-book movie. Joker is someone who saw Scorsese films, particularly Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy but doesn\u2019t understand why they work. As Scorsese often does, Joker presents a villain as a hero in his own story. His heroes are often far from good people. That\u2019s why we love to watch Travis Bickle or Jordan Belfort. We get into the head of someone we cannot truly identify with as they tell us their actions are justified. But we also know teye aren\u2019t. They are kept an arm\u2019s distance away, with a level of satire or social-commentary. However, Joker leaves out the satire, presenting Fleck as a direct protagonist: a man who cracks after being broken by the system. He\u2019s had enough, and society must crumble.One feels we\u2019re meant to follow his action as justified and ultimately the \u201chero\u201d Gotham needs and deserves. There is a kernel of truth and reason mixed in. The system fails those who need it most. Fleck loses access to his medication and social worker when the social worker\u2019s entire department is closed for budget cuts. We live in a world where people in need, whether it be from mental illness, addiction, or poverty. These people keep finding their support cut off, and society then get upset with bad things happen.", "This is lost in a mishmash of undercooked and misguided ideas. Fleck is a manifesto of the angry male loner. He works an underwhelming job as a party-clown. He lives with his mother in his forties. He desires the woman down the hall, but she barely knows his name \u2013 and considers him to be a threat. He\u2019s told he creeps people out, and not to talk to their kids. He just can\u2019t get a break. The whole world is against him, no one listens to him Everyone but his mother is the enemy. What\u2019s worse, his actions are blamed on mental illness, directly stated in the climax, giving more backing to presenting the mentally ill as a threat rather than regular people.", "Phoenix is forced to try to make a compelling performance from this. He\u2019s a fantastic actor who gives care to his roles. He\u2019s saddled with a script that gives little. He surely gives an interesting performance in the same way Jack Nicholson does as Jack in The Shining. Both of these are starting at 11, already lost-causes, two seconds away from violence. There is no arc. Performance wise they can be moved around their films with no difference in how they are behaving.  The character\u2019s an empty cipher meant for the viewer to pour into. For an origin story, there is precious little true backstory. A moment of abuse, a life-time of caring for his mother, and a mention of committal. Who is Fleck, really? Phillips doesn\u2019t care. Joker is a tone-deaf film, providing either wrong-headed commentary directly or underdone ideas it feels are grander. Through all its pomp and anger and muddled messaging, Joker doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s dull and repetitive, slogging on from one scene to another, powered by an awkward and on the nose script. Any time the hammer Phillips wields hits the nail, it is purely by accident. There are moments that almost work, where a glimmer of a good film shines through and where it almost feels poignant with something to actually say. But each time this occurs it\u2019s soon lost in the weeds."]},

After watching the film, I can't explain the amount of disappointment I felt. The movie itself is an incredibly slow burn that takes quite a bit of patience to endure. This movie is extremely loosely connected to the Batman mythos and that is putting it mildly. The title of the film is probably the only thing \"Joker\" about this movie. The film portrays itself as a deep, methodical view on mental health struggles and how society treats those that struggle from them. This would have been a better film if it was not in any way connected to the comic character. Not basing this portrayal on any story from the comics was a very bold move and one that made me worried and rigtfully so it would seem. The movie doesn't really know what kind of story it wants to tell. I wouldn't call this an origin story since Arthur Fleck is in no way the Joker that we all know and love. He is like the Party City version of the beloved character. Imagine if some fanboy tried to emulate what being the joker is like for college film project and that's what you get with this film.

He was never really funny (even though comedy is subjective as Arthur states himself) he isn't really a criminal he just kind of stumbles and fumbles through every situation, and most importantly he wasn't smart or conniving. This is supposed to the legendary, the infamous, the iconic villain of Batman in the future? A weak, pathetic, mentally ill  clown that can't even keep a job or take care of his mother. Everything is handed to this character through plot driven circumstances. Oh the crowd just happens to get riled up just in time so he can slip through and meet Thomas Wayne. He didn't rile up the crowd, or plan a diversion how did he get a service outfit to blend in? Oh it was just laying around in a service closet just his size. The real Joker is smart and that is what allows him to go to to toe with the greatest detective of all time. He doesn't just get the luckiest circumstances in the world and just happens to beat Batman. He plans and schemes and puts on a show and actually knows how to be funny if he wants to be. The only reason I think this has good reviews is because my generation doesn't know the characters, and joaquin phoenix is an amazing artist bringing the role he was told to play to life. If this was a random movie about a random clown with mental illness and tragic story it would be a decent movie. As a movie supposedly portraying the Joker it was the worst movie DC has made so far.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["To say that Todd Phillip\u2019s \u2018Joker\u2019 is a dangerous movie is to give it too much credence, but it is a deeply offensive one.  Ultimately, it\u2019s just a silly superhero origin story, but it\u2019s presented in such a \u2018realist\u2019 style, and so forcefully, that people might actually take it as a serious movie.  It has all the style and surface veneer of a classic 1970s movie, as has been pointed out by numerous reviewers.  Visually, it can\u2019t be faulted for its cinematography.  It\u2019s the script and characterisation that are lacking.  Nobody would go into a film based on a comic book expecting a serious character study, but, by tackling the genre in the style of such a movie, that is what you are falsely enticed to expect.  Unfortunately, that is not what you get.  The viewer is presented with a mentally ill man, living with his disabled mother, who becomes a deranged serial killer who incites mass violence.  This could have been an in-depth psychological exploration of one man\u2019s descent into the maelstrom, that gives the viewer some insight into how a corrupt and insensitive society can push a vulnerable individual over the edge, as those well-known seventies movies did to some extent.  Such a narrative requires nuance, sensitivity, compassion and tact, or risk demonising the vulnerable.  The very lack of any of the aforementioned does just that \u2013 it sets back the mentally ill fifty years or more.  What we have here is a series of episodic vignettes \u2013 admittedly in the style of a comic book \u2013 in which, through a series of gross oversimplifications, the put-upon protagonist slowly loses his grip on reality and descends into graphic violence.  Each prior vignette is treated in such a superficial manner that they serve merely as lame justification for the gory set pieces.", "Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance is intense and physical, but, in the absence of any human depth, proves to be nothing more than a leering caricature.  Lingering, over-stylised shots of his manic posturing does not equate to a meaningful performance, however fully the actor has thrown himself into the part.  Instead, when the movie reaches its riotous denouement, rather than a criticism of the society that led to his downfall, we are presented with a film that seems to celebrate and encourage the very ills that incites his violence.  Points of comparison are \u2018Assassination Nation\u2019 and, to a lesser extent, \u2018Spring Breakers\u2019.  It is this very confusion, simultaneously vilifying the vulnerable and championing them as an anarchic anti-hero, undercutting the capitalist ruling class, that serves to further stigmatise the mentally ill.  At the risk of sounding alarmist, younger viewers - older teenagers and those in their early twenties - the very audience that such a film is aimed at, or anyone else with a na\u00efve lack of understanding of mental health, for that matter, could come away from this movie with less empathy for the isolated and marginalised than they went in, thinking the film is cool, when it\u2019s far from that.  For that reason, it is reckless and misjudged, but what should we expect from the director of puerile frat movie \u2018Old School\u2019 and laddy stag film \u2018The Hangover\u2019?"]},

I'm definitely burnt out on origin stories lately, and furthermore, I've always liked Joaquin Phoenix as an actor, but I wasn't too sure if he'd have what it takes to get this iconic role just right, something only 'The Dark Knight's' Heath Ledger has managed to do so far in my opinion. After seeing this... I can confidently say that I really could've done without this film. I found myself thoroughly unimpressed with just about every scene, moment, etc. The entire film felt sleazy to a fault, seeming content to wallow in its own filth and misery. In addition, the film definitely seemed like it was short on ideas, which would explain why half the film seemingly consisted of scenes of Phoenix doing nothing but dancing, laughing manically, and acting like a fool. It really felt like nothing more than an excuse for him to act like his usual weird self for two long hours. For those hoping that he'd live up to the hype that he supposedly surpasses Ledger's performance as the Joker, in my eyes, it's no contest. Ledger is still far and out the superior performance. I could tell Phoenix was having fun with his take on the character, but that's about it. Overall, not only did this film feel quite unnecessary, to me, it was also self-pitying and forgettable."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["JOKER is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. It pains me that so many \"critics\" rip into this movie for absolutely absurd reasons. This film is probably the best \"superhero\" movie produced since 2008. Of course, it isn't a superhero film, but it is made by DC with a comic character as the protagonist. I have seen this movie TWICE and I am more impressed with this solo project than I am with the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe AND 20th Century Fox X-Men Universe combined. Movies like The Dark Knight and Logan have proved superhero movies can be as much a brilliant art-piece as the most beautiful films ever made (Films like The Green Mile, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc..), and so does JOKER.", "Joaquin Phoenix is goddamn phenomenal in the role, he absolutely carries this character the whole way through and I could not see a single other person playing this character so well. Joaquin terrifies me in this movie; it's honestly insane how crazy and scary he is, while also evoking a ton of sympathy from me in the opening act.", "If I could describe his portrayal in the best way I could, I would say: at the start of this film, he makes me want to curl up and cry. At the end of this film, he makes me want to cry for an entirely different reason. And that's not even all down to Joaquin.", "Todd Phillips has crafted the PERFECT comic book movie in my eyes. The camera work, the directing, the writing, the story, the plot twists... It is all amazing. This film truly messes with you in the most incredible way a movie could with some very Fight Club style plot twists that left me stunned. I remember being sat in the cinema for my first viewing gawking at the whole thing with my hands behind my head and my eyes widened watching in disbelief and horror and pure amusement and entertainment. And on my second viewing, I remember being so entertained by the amount of things you pick up after the first watch: all the dots that connect together, all the foreshadowing and clues and hints... It's truly magnificent how a movie can make me walk out giving it a 10/10 TWICE. I'd be willing to say on second viewing it is a lot more entertaining than the first viewing in multiple ways, which is surprising seeing as I left the first time utterly mesmerized. To say the body count in this film is rather low, the violence and brutality is extremely high. It's not like any other basic blockbuster that presents killing as an easy one-shot and dead scenario... No. This film presents killing as insanely harsh and difficult. Even the character Arthur Fleck shooting someone with a handgun once comes across as terrifying, in one of the final scenes. And that scissors kill was absolutely paralyzing. I sat there in my seat in utter dread and... well, horror. I don't know how else to describe it. HORROR.", "The critics are saying this film glamorizes violence and many other ridiculous things. But, at its core, no it does not glamorize violence. It discourages it, if anything. It discourages a lot of things. This is a very accurate representation of the every man who is constantly picked on and wronged by society. It presents the world outside of the ivory tower every movie protagonist seems to live in. I know a lot of people like those that pick on Arthur Fleck in this film. And the film should be a lesson for people to not act like this at all, otherwise extreme events may ensue. And it glamorizing violence is a ridiculous statement, as it presents killing as horrifying, dark and difficult. It shook me to the core seeing deaths in this movie, and definitely gave me the opposite opinion on \"cool, brutal\" kills in movies, like in the John Wick movies. Now, I cannot talk about this film without briefly mentioning Gotham City. The best representation of Gotham City in any DC movie.", "The Dark Knight Trilogy presented it as gritty and chaotic, but again that was through the eyes of Batman. And it was always full of explosions and action and riots. The Tim Burton movies presented it as an over-the-top, steampunk and bleak area. The DCEU presents it as... Nothing. And the Arkham games present it as gritty and crime infested. JOKER presents it as an awful place to live, full of stuck-up, rich pricks who pick on the less fortunate. Much like any city, but it gets its own character. It's compact, it's corrupted, and it's dirty. It's like a mirror image of Arthur Fleck's mental state. It's run down and it's getting worse and worse without the help of Thomas Wayne, who acts like he cares about the events occurring within the city and the protagonist, but really he's selfish and only cares for himself and his family. It's incredibly poetic.", "And the scene with the Waynes... I needn't say much but... It's possibly the best representation of the murders made, and the poetry of Joker's birth happening with Batman's birth is incredible.", "The ending, too, left me speechless and in awe.", "This film is very well deserving of a 10/10"]},

There are scenes where you are not sure if you should laugh or feel sad (kind of how Fry from Futurama was conflicted with fear and joy when sentenced to death by snu-snu). There are moments that make you laugh (if you like dark humor like me). The comedy is similar to Joan Cornella\u2019s morbid comedic illustrations. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s acting makes the character believable. His unique laughter sounds a bit painful and sad. When the situation goes south, the actor does a great job of performing the fight or flight behavior.

The character is not a simple, black and white personality, instead he is a complex multi-layered individual that makes him entertaining to observe.", "The movie is realistic/grounded. Corrupt behavior is created and not born and there is tons of research to back this up. The Joker was not born with a corrupt mind. The film does a great job showing how the environment molded his corrupt behavior. Thomas Wayne\u2019s portrayal is believable because someone in his position of wealth and power would behave the way he does (although there are a few wealthy people out there that are cool). The film has high quality violence (laugh out loud). This movie makes the violence feel shocking and serious. Other movies have too much violence that it starts to feel cheap and not a big deal (these films are still fun to watch though).", "This is one of the reasons why I love video games like The Last of Us or movies like Coco because they put plenty of effort in all of the departments (story, character development, believable acting, and an effective atmosphere).

For the first hour the film takes us in so many directions and introduces so many messages and themes that I struggled to identify what the film was trying to be. There were also some character decisions made that I didn't appreciate. I know Todd Phillips is trying to make something different compared to most comic book movies, but some of the decisions made to Jokers origin and how they treated some of the supporting characters bugged me. there's also a point where the film should have ended, but it didn't and another scene is added, instantly I knew the film should've ended when it did, the last 4 minutes make no sense and add an extra few minutes to the film that doesn't need to be there.

The ending is also very good, it lets you choose what parts of the movie are real and what parts are just Arthur\u2019s hallucinations or fantasies.

La crudeza de las im\u00e1genes, la violencia, y una clara cr\u00edtica al sistema capitalista hacen de Joker una cinta compleja y para nada olvidable.

But when he is the exact opposite of that, non the less he is treated like an icon, he walks downstairs in joy, meaning that when he forgets about morality and does whatever he wants, he feels relieved and actually, for once in his life, happy, even if it means becoming not even the shadow of what he used to be, morally and ethically. The music blends in perfectly in every scene, it might overload the feeling of sadness in some parts, but then again this IS a drama movie.", "The backstory of the joker being told ruins NOTHING at all, it still gives you a great character. To make a good movie doesn\u2019t always mean that the character has to learn to be a better version of himself, or improve, to make a good movie you have to see the development of that character into what he came to be and at least have compassion for him and that\u2019s what joker did. It\u2019s not about the ending, it\u2019s about the route that the character took towards that ending. This story is NOT venerating violence, it\u2019s a warning of how people end up like that and it tells you to be careful, while telling you a story of how Arthur Fleck is neither white or black, he is just man who never got to take a break in life, even though he always tried to show the best of himself, it was just never enough, so he just gave up and out of fear he committed horrible/regrettable actions. He just snapped. You get to know his ambitions, dreams and current state from the beginning of the movie in the result that\u2019ll make you have compassion for him, so in moments where he commits a horrible act you feel disappointed, yet still have hope for his redemption. We normally see the redemption or rise of the character at the epilogue of the movies, but this one is here to show us that\u2019s not always like that and that it shouldn\u2019t be.", "Joker is a messed up masterpiece."]},

He is so nuanced and excels at making you feel uncomfortable. Joaquin has such a unique body language in this. This version of the Joker has a condition where he can laugh uncontrollably, and the actor does a great job of making it feel realistic and unpleasant. He also appears to have lost a lot of weight in this. The Joker is traditionally portrayed as a skinny feller but here the movie uses this to make the character feel at times downright primal or sickly, matching his mental state.", "However, the movie should not have been two hours long. In order to show the events that create the Joker, Phillips over-compensates and throws way too many plot points at the guy. There are moments that are quite tedious, especially in the middle. There is a also a subplot I was really not found of that reeks of uninspired fan-fiction.", "To be honest, this was such a grounded piece by superhero comic standards that it could've been a non-comic book film. Yeah, DC is trying to show that these films can be more prestigious and serious, but by taking out the over-the-top parts of the superhero genre, I feel we may lose what made them special in the first place.", "This is the first real comic supervillain movie. (Venom's movie was an anti-hero flick.) But taking the comics into account: his isn't the first attempt to redo a supervillain's origina story. I feat that a lot of these stories frustratingly tend to recycle concepts and this is no exception. These include: 1) Make the villain's story darker than previous incarnations. 2) Have one of their few connections be with a mother and/or romantic interest or fixation (Zazie Beets' character could've been cut out of this completely without changing anything).", "Considering that this is about a burgeoning psychopath, you can probably guess, but just to confirm: this is a REALLy dark movie. Violence doesn't happen all the time but when it does: Whoo-boy! Phillips has publicly mentioned that the films of Scorses, such as Taxi Driver and The Comedian, greatly influenced him. So, be forewarned if that's not your thing.", "I really had a hard time deciding on the rating for this. On one hand, Phillips, who has directed comedies up till now, surprisingly pulls off quite a confident, intriguing cinematic experience. The movie managed to elicit an emotional response from me that very few films have. However, the issues I mentioned prevented me from loving this or watching a second time. Some of the theater audience at the end clapped, but I personally don't think the movie was strong enough to justify that."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["For decades now, the comic book genre has always seen spectacle, fantasy, powers and it's mostly fantastical. However, in recent years, we have seen them evolve and try to put characters in the front, there have been many great deep character moments in the genre with films from; 'The Dark Knight' (2008), 'Logan' (2017) and even 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) focusing greatly on characters dealing with the situations they are in with those respective stories. Enter 'Joker', the latest standalone DC film from director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover') and he uses Joaquin Phoenix in the title role to tell this story of a man named Arthur Fleck. Arthur lives a very quiet, if not, insignificant life as a clown who holds up sale signs, he aspires to be a stand-up comedian and lives in a small apartment with his mother whose mental issues seem to pass onto him. Every night, Arthur and his mother like to watch \"Live with Murray Franklin\", and enjoy watching the talk show host Franklin (Robert DeNiro) bringing a sense of light and fun into their lives. The movie mainly focuses greatly on Arthur, and his turn from socially awkward individual, into a psychologically damaged sociopath. He has a condition which makes him laugh out loud uncontrollably in awkward situations, and he gets medication regularly to keep him sane. However, when a series of bad things happen to him day after day, and nothing seems to improve, Arthur then begins to question if it's him that's the problem, or is it the outside world. The film is appropriately bleak, and sets a very uncomfortable tone, with Phillips deliberately holding onto long shots for extended periods of time to create a sense of unease. Not to mention that you do feel bad for Arthur, the movie is very much told from his point of view, so you come to understand why Arthur behaves the way he does, not that it's justified, but it's in the nature of his character. As you know, the Joker has an infamously non-existent origin story. We just know him as a deranged clown who murders for the thrill. Here, Phillips has given the character, not only a name, but a plausible origin story that could work as a prequel to 'The Dark Knight' (2008), with some things altered here and there, of course. Phoenix is also terrific in the role, as his presence makes you feel unclean and uncomfortable, his voice and mannerisms convey a sympathetic sociopath, and there is even some subtlety to it as well. He doesn't try too hard to chew up the scenery, he just behaves appropriately to the environment that surrounds him. Not since the late Heath Ledger, have we seen this iconic Batman villain portrayed with such skill. Placing a comic book character and grounding him in a more realistic reality, just as James Mangold did to Wolverine with 'Logan' (2017), was definitely a smart move. It will remind you of two Scorsese classics such as; 'Taxi Driver' (1976) and 'The King of Comedy' (1982), both of which also star Robert DeNiro. I think it's great that the comic book genre was able to arrive at a point to tell a psychopathic story, we've never seen that in this genre before. Who knows when it will be the next time we see another comic film like this, but the fact that they can mix it up means this genre can bring surprises and is here to stay."]},

My problem with the movie is that the script cant handle all of the themes subtly, especially when we are talking Arthur hallucinating, and they just couldn't lose the chance and they just had to put Bruce Wayne and the Wayne family in the movie. Also, there are somethings in the movie that goes nowhere, in the beginning, they talk about the garbage collectors having a strike and then they talk about because of the strike and the huge amount of garbage in the street they have now super rats? And then this goes nowhere and it is never mentioned again in the whole movie and it felt dumb. Talking about trying to be subtly, Arthurs's girlfriend being a hallucination I saw that coming a mile away, it's like the screenwriter had some good ideas but he just could not execute them very well.

Terminator Dark Fate (for the brief seconds I saw while entering the IMAX Auditorium since there was a 5-Minute preview in front of Joker in IMAX) looks fookin\u2019 spectacular. Such a shame Italy won\u2019t release it in IMAX 3D\u2026", "2. This movie has a great friendship with A Quiet Place for \u201cDead Silent...Stone Cold Audience I\u2019ve ever had at a Movie\u201d", "3.  DC Black may be the studio I\u2019m most looking forward out of all the other CBM Studios,but it\u2019s no surprise given Warner Bros\u2019 fantastic year (so far)...", "End of notes.", "The worst part of Joker may be the fact that I\u2019ve seen all of this coming from the trailers. Guy gets slapped by Society,he starts to get mad,and so here we have an Odyssey of Madness that\u2019ll turn him into the Clown Prince Of Crime,yadda yadda,we all know it by now. But,the thing that makes it stand amongst other character studies done by the numbers is the rather unnerving nature of the character we\u2019re following (played by Joaquin Phoenix with mesmerizing attitude) and the fact that,for a Director last known for making Comedies,this feels like such a huge directorial shift (besides the kinda harsh comment he made on Recent Comedies). This may be the scariest IMAX Experience I\u2019ve had since...I dunno...Mission Impossible Fallout? Which isn\u2019t saying much,considering I\u2019ve never seen a scary movie in IMAX.", "What also fuels the movie up to 11 is the fact that this is my movie. A movie that says many things about the harsh and insulting society we\u2019re living in right now (another movie like this is Taxi Driver,of which the movie takes inspiration from. No,seriously,there\u2019s a sequence involving Arthur toying around with a gun that feels similar to Travis Bickle\u2019s \u201cyou talking to me?\u201d),which is better than great for me,as I despise the lots and lots of people that behave like they\u2019re the most important being in existence,complete with self-indulgence and insults towards others. All spectacular stuff for this movie. But,while most of it feels earned,I don\u2019t think it needs to fully embrace it,since there\u2019s a minority about people who actually know what they\u2019re doing and hope they can literally \u201crebuild the world\u201d as it was. Yeah,I\u2019m getting ahead of myself,but it\u2019s something I really wanted to talk about in a long time,internet or not. And it feels unreal that I\u2019m talking about it in a Comicbook Movie that shouldn\u2019t work if done in other ways. But if it stopped itself from fully embracing the theme of Society,then we wouldn\u2019t have gotten the big-ass epic finale it had,with a speech that,while feels forced by WB,didn\u2019t bother me at all,especially with a worse gripe than the speech. That being the blatant and unnecessary Batman references. At first it was cute,but during the finale,it felt sort of rushed.  Not for Thomas Wayne,since he was part of the plot,but for the sake of the studio trying to Franchise this up,therefore losing the soul the movie was aiming to have,and making it just \u201cAnother Comicbook romp\u201d. Speaking of that,yeah,it stars a Comicbook character as the main lead,and the title is Joker,but should I even consider it a Comicbook Movie? Character aside,this feels more a Character-driven film rather than a CBM,and,while there are action sequences (and Violence) in it,it doesn\u2019t matter all that much considering the Nature of the Story we\u2019re being told,nor is it as insulting as the troll reviewers are talking about (there are positive reviews,no worries,but I hate making fun of these critics,since it ain\u2019t my thing,and I know there will always be more of them in other movies). But all in all,I think Joker is my Iron Man. While I\u2019ve seen most Comicbook Movies by this point,I never had one where it felt like a proper introduction to the Genre (besides Spider-Verse),and anticipating it as \u201cThe Rebirth Of Comicbook Fare\u201d was definitely my thing. Sure,it wasn\u2019t the greatest movie of all everyone was talking about,but that still didn\u2019t stop me from being thoroughly surprised by it. The fact it doesn\u2019t show the DC logo at the beginning is already a Plus."]},
{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["To try and compete with the high standard set by Ledger is an uphill struggle to say the least, but Phoenix's performance captivated me from start to finish. I love the continuity of the character. His portrayal of the character is dark and beautiful but still distinct from Ledger's. He has created his own mannerisms with the character. You can see the hard work he's put into this performance. From the look in his eyes, his stance around certain people. \"The Joker\" is undoubtebly a flawed person, but I've never sympathised with him before, or at least to the extent that I notice it. I find myself comparing our protagonist, Arthur, to Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver. You can see they're excluded from society, spat on, in a city that is rotten. One can sympathise with them at the start, but later on we see the cracks appear.", "The film has beautiful moments that tie it all together too. For instance, I appreciate how the beginning and end mirror eachother, and that the character ends up parallel to who he was at the start.", "It starts with a smile, and a psychiatrist,", "and ends with a smile, and a psychiatrist.", "Arthur at the start is trying to be happy in an oppressed and dysfunctional world.", "Arthur at the end is happy his life means something and he's bringing opportunity for people to make themselves happier through revolution, with the wall of the class divide burning away in Gotham.", "I also appreciate the use of theme in this film. From start to finish the film paints a sincere-feeling message about male mental health awareness and the problems that Social Exclusion can cause on vulnerable people- a theme which I feel should be at the forefront of society, but is so often shoved to the back in favour of other issues. The outrage from media outlets prior to release only purports this- practically encouraging a shooting in theatres so they can condemn the person who *they* gave the platform for atrocities to be committed through, via their constant publicity about it. Ironically, the film speaks directly to that, with the Late Night Show scene in the ending third of the film, martyrising Arthur as starting a revolution. The film isn't trying to advocate for murder of people, that's not the message one can take away from it. The real message I found was that vulnerable members of society should be treated. Arthur's character was neglected, beaten, \"tied to a radiator with bruises on him,\" and yet he remained in the house with his mother, and turned into a social outcast. He gets all the sources of help cut off from him, so he is left isolated. This speaks to contemporary American society too, where medical and mental help costs, and often is only available to those who might not need it as much as a working class family may, seen as most mental health issues lie with the impoverished. This film says a lot without coming off as insincere as other comic book character films do. It doesn't cram a message down your face with a one liner, nor does it try and deprocate itself through \"self-aware comedy\" like every other Marvel film (hint hint \"What Are Those!\" and every line said to make the characters awkward after a big moment)", "This feels like a true Tragedy. The art style of the film, the soundtrack with those harsh strings, vivid lighting in sections, and the overall design and portrayal of the character is in a world of its own. I thought nothing could top Ledger's performance, but honestly, Phoenix has me convinced."]},

Saying that Joaquin Phoenix was wonderful in his role would be stating the obvious, because pretty much everyone has praised his performance and I agree, he is honestly the best actor of the year so far. Both his acting and the writing of his character is what gives Arthur Fleck/Joker a realism that we have never seen before in any other interpretation of the character. The movie really made me get inside the mind of the title character, to see that he is not just \"a crazy person\" but that he was a human like anyone else. His journey to become the iconic villain is genuinely interesting, and made me care about the character. That is why I think that the character development and acting are the best things about the movie. Robert De Niro was also pretty good. I thought that he would \"phone it in\", but he ended up doing a nice job. The cinematography was also pretty good. There is a little amount of visual storytelling(not too much and it isn't like arthouse film level or anything) and the movie looks aesthetically beautiful to be honest.", "My issues with this movie are with the script.

Something so deeply unsettling, visceral, and yet impossible to turn away from. So mind-searingly horrific, yet deeply emotional and thematically resonant. So incredibly well-crafted and performed that I honestly cannot help but include it among my favorites for the entire year. I mean, look around. You can't swing a cat without striking someone with thoughts on this movie and its meanings/implications for our times. For all of this to emanate from a movie based on a comic book character honestly amazes me in the best way, no matter how exhausting some of the discussions have become. In an age where every comic book film is compared to and contrasted with every other iteration from its own canon, other canons, etc., I totally understand why there's a fatigue that's come about in response to it all.

The movie shows the differences between the poor and the rich and shows the struggles of the real world.

He has just been kicked down over and over again. He feels that life is just nasty and short and nobody cares?! The human race is bad. Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job of conveying that vulnerability and rage. With the mood swings and crazy laugh it's hard to imagine that you want him to be the hero not a villain. In his mind he is the hero ridding the world of cruel people. There have been several very different portrayals of the Joker in other movies but by far Joaquin Phoenix is in a class of his own. A dark character that you feel sympathy and empathy for. He's aware a monster is evolving inside of him and he struggles with it before releasing it.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["An excellent movie. A high qualitative performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The pictures are awesome, the music fits perfectly. I think that the interpretation of the Joker's laugh is really original. The idea of a sad Joker whose laugh does not show happiness is for me the more interesting Joker. A sad, complicated character who does not even plan to be a criminal. The circumstances lead him to his true path in life. His tics, his moves, his behavior as a whole built a true crazy character. The dance moves in the film add some extra beauty to his performance. Heath Ledger (another near-perfect performance of the Clown prince of crime) was to me too conscious. He had so many plans and shemes, he had opinions about the society and plans how to test it and this I feel is not typicall for a crazy person. I like the weaknesses of this Joker. The crazy little tics he shows throughout the film. You can see that he is actually a sick man not just because he kills people. The messege is nothing new for the film industy - the little man who is neglected by the society. That is why I gave it 9, not 10. When it comes to comparing the Ledger and the Phoenix interpretation of the Joker I think there are two viewpoints. Some would prefer the Joker to be the apex predator in Gotham, forcing everybody to kneel before him. I prefer the Joker being crazy, emotional, sometimes weak and vulnerable and sad. You will always find something in every movie that you would change. But you should see the movie as it is and you should judge by what you have seen, not by what you would've wanted to see."]},
{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["I saw Joker last night at the Studio Movie Grill in Marietta, GA. There were two police officers on hand, but it was a very calm and peaceful evening. The theater was completely full and there were a lot of people who clapped and even cried during the movie. However, not once did I ever fear for my safety or my life. Never once did I feel or sense there was going to be anarchy, chaos, or a riot after the movie. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE. Just like any other action movie with guns, violence, and killing in it (F&F, John Wick, etc., etc.). All in all, I thought 2019's Joker was a great movie is a masterpiece with an oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Pheonix. It was a very human movie. It show's a man who's been broken down, beaten, lied to, and mistreated his whole life. A man who feels isolated, alone, unwanted, and unloved in a system and society completely against him. Because of the way the film is portrayed and because of the incredible talent of Joaquin Phoenix, you can empathize and sympathize with his character. You feel sorry for him and all of the incredibly unjust bs he goes through. You may even find yourself wishing you could help him. Because of that, you can understand his descent into madness and the reason behind all of his characters' actions (not that they were wholly just or correct by any means). It gave depth and insight into the Joker's and Batman's (Bruce Wayne's) relationship and their history as a prequel movie. The ONLY things I can think of why certain groups of people might be against this movie are: 1) They don't like DC Comics or Batman. 2) They don't like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. 3) They're afraid that the movie will empower self-righteous people who are fed-up with a corrupt government into taking action and causing Anarchy (like in the movie). 4) They think that grown adults don't have any common sense and/or general reasoning skills, can't distinguish between reality and fiction, and cannot control their own thoughts and actions. All-in-all, I thought this was a wonderful adaptation and I would highly recommend this film to all my family and friends. 10/10."]},
{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Joker is a wonderfully crafted movie depicting the plight of Arthur Fleck and how he is betrayed by the system and people of his society. Arthur Fleck has a mental illness. Anyone with any sensory functions can see this. Because of this character trait, the media have stirred up controversy over this character because of how he is portrayed. Joker is not some \"incel guide\" to teach mentally disturbed white men how to become violent menaces, it's a deep and captivating story about someone who struggles with mental issues and is belittled for his condition. The reason why these so called \"critics\" and media outlets **** on this movie is because they are afraid of facing reality. This kind of thing happens in real life all the time. Not everyone with a mental illness becomes a mass killer, but when someone is failed by the system and everyone around them, there is a potential risk of creating a monster. The movie is not the problem, it is the people that constantly throw the blame on external factors, when in reality it is the fault of themselves. I felt for Arthur Fleck and could empathize with his past and situation. It's hard to watch this movie and not want to go through the screen and give him a hug, lend him an ear to listen, or to find him a better therapist. I am in no way justifying his actions, because they are cruel and unforgivable. But it's hard not to empathize with someone who has been spat down on their entire life, with no hope of recovery whatsoever. If you go into this movie expecting a family friendly cake walk, then you're in for a wild surprise. It is rated R for a reason. It deals with themes that are surprisingly real and raw. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding and he really displayed the character well through his wonderful acting. I, as someone who doesn't really know much about DC, really enjoyed this movie as a work of art and a social commentary. I cannot speak of it's accuracy to the Joker story, but it made me interested to dive deeper into the DC universe. If you enjoy movies that are gritty and put you through an emotional roller coaster, than this is the movie for you."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Personally I really liked the movie. It took a somewhat predictable and flat character as the Joker of the comic books that he can't seem to escape from the stereotype of the psychopath mastermind who causes chaos for no apparent reason at all. This leads to an empty plot and it shows a great indifference for the struggles of a person with a mental disorder. On the other hand Arthur Fleck seems a much more relatable figure. He is a person who struggles with his mental illness and who is trying his best to fit into the world. He tries to become one with the crowd and to feel connected with the others, while society seems to never care about him or other individuals that are a bit different than the normal. The Gotham city is appeared to be a dystopia where great social struggles take place. The rich remain rich and the poor must live in the isolation, the crime and the fear of survival. There is no providence for their lives and their health and most of them live in misery.  Everyone is at the point where they want to rebel against a machine that only works for the rich. Everyone lives a life that is almost unbearable and this is portrayed through Arthur. Arthur tries his best to be a good person, to live a normal life and to make his dream even if it's hopeless to come true. His mental illness is very severe and the state doesn't seem to care at all for people like him. Essentially he is all alone in a world where he is considered a freak that can easily turn to a scapegoat. With this kind of indifference and isolation the character develops and falls little by little into madness. It's the society's ways that committed the crime before Arthur did it himself. At this point the movie builds a lot into the character of Joker and gives him a certain depth to realize that he isn't a farfetched character, but a normal person who suffered and was pushed to crime by an estranged society that cheers the social differences. I like how the movie plays with the layers of truth from the start till the very end. I like how everything seems to lead to a certain structure and then this structure is being destroyed as if to portray how a human can feel deconstructed by the coldness of his surrounding environment. I believe that the movie is essentially social and makes us all feel a little more sympathy for people with mental illness as well as contemplate on our way of life and the dangers the system may hide. The clown uprising in the town is nothing but the eruption of accumulated misery in a society where only the rich can flourish, while the poor are always being neglected and walked upon. It's not the first time that someone even a murderer becomes an idol for his actions when such social struggles take place and this is what makes this movie real. The actors were all amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, the protagonist is simply brilliant and the plot is essentially deep and meaningful. I like all the associations the plot can enable with sociology, psychology, literature and history. I love to see the building of a character and I find that certain scenes were simply amazing and ingenious. One of them must be the Joker meeting young Bruce. We don't have two mortal enemies there, but a troubled man who wants to find the truth who tries not to scare of a little boy. Yes he is manipulative towards him but at the same time he has nothing against him and throughout the movie we see that Arthur was very friendly towards the children. It gave me chills to see their interaction to be so friendly and simple knowing that later on they will be enemies. I really liked the idea to connect the arc of Joker with Bruce's loss of his parents since it shows that in reality we don't have a black and white picture but many shades of gray in between. Every action has a reaction and even if the first seems right to one there's always a different perspective. The same applies with the reality. Some choose to see the story of Joker to be nothing but a joke he made while he was talking with his psychiatrist (as to say a very pessimistic and nihilistic turn to what makes us humans) but at the same time someone can read this scene differently. All of his story could easily happen and it makes a lot of sense according with what we saw to feel sorry and a certain sympathy for this troubled character. Yet everyone seems to forget it all again after the force of the system takes down the uprising. All of these events didn't bring the change he wanted to see, didn't make him more lovable to the crowd didn't give him the happiness he was searching, rather he is portrayed as the villain and the society seems to return to point zero.."]},

In my humble opinion, this movie is the definition of MASTERPIECE."]},

He also idolised the talk show host, Franklin Murray (De Niro) and wants to be like him one day. Life in Gotham City is very difficult for him because the city is filled with crimes, unemployment and society is very heavily divided between the rich and poor.", "Arthur also has a disorder which causes him to laugh at inappropriate times and he always relied on social services program for his medication. His life starts to get from bad to worse when he lost his job due to bringing a gun to a children's hospital while entertaining the children which is meant for his own protection and being sold out by his friend who gave him the gun to protect his own skin.", "The worst things happened to him does not stop there. After he lost his job, he gets beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises employees in a subway train which forced him to kill two of them with his gun in self-defense and execute the last one when he attempts to escape. Not long after that, he loses access to his medication after the social services program got shut down due to budget cut and learns a horrifying truth about his mother along with his past. Arthur's fall to the path of darkness begins here.", "While it may not be part of the shared universe, this movie is really great and the tone is very dark and even better when combined with the plot which is very well written and executed. It is even darker than 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Dark Knight Trilogy.", "What I love about the movie are the character developement and ambiguous nature. For the former, I love how Arthur Fleck's journey began from a nobody who is ignored by society until his transformation into an iconic villain being depicted. He worked very hard as working man but after all that hard work, he always ended up getting beaten, betrayed and even being mock by other people. All these bad things happened to him had led him to become a villain. All it takes to change a person was a \"one bad day\".", "For the latter, Todd Phillips managed to make the movie into an open ended and more than one interpretation. This is true to the source material because Joker does not really have an origin story in the comic book. In the comic book itself, Joker prefer his origin story to be a multiple choice. This multiple choice was used in the movie which really made you think whether which parts of his origin are true and what other parts are false. It is really up to audiences' interpretation. That is what made the movie plot really great.", "Joaquin Phoenix is really amazing in his performance as Joker. He put up a lot of effort in this role and he successfully nailed it. His dances in some scenes and his Joker laugh are very impressive. In addition, his version of Joker is right on par with the late Heath Ledger, who portrayed Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight. His acting skills is definitely an Oscars worthy be nominate as Best Actor and might even have the chance to win that award.", "This movie is truly a masterpiece for a low budget superhero (or supervillain in this case) movie. I would definitely recommend to watch this movie to everyone and not just comic book fans."]},

Despite a history of various actors completely nailing the role director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix bring to life an extremely original take on this much beloved character. Arthur Fleck is a mentally ill professional clown with dreams of becoming a stand up comedian. But after a series of traumatic/hurtful experiences Arthur slowly begins to crack as he is edged closer and closer to insanity. Many critics including Peter Bradshaw (the guardian) have criticized joker for its ambiguous handling of morals and encouraging of violent behavior, however I can confirm that this is not the case. Although our protagonist is an extremely troubled man and his actions are far from virtuous, we don\u2019t sympathise with Arthur because of his attributes as a person, but because of how badly he is treated by others. Todd Phillips does an excellent job of shining a light on real world problems, whether it be wealthy capitalists who don\u2019t hold any concern for the poor or stage show hosts who practically make profit from ridiculing others. Although some of it may be a bit far fetched it is purposefully done this way in order to prevent the film from feeling too political. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding In every aspect, and his performance is definitely Oscar worthy. The supporting cast as well, although not as heavily focused on, certainly never falter. Another feature that separates Joker from most films of its genre is steering clear of the trends of blockbuster action. When there is the occasional moment of violence it feels dark, gritty and shocking to say the least. Another problem that critics claim exists is that the film draws heavy inspiration from other movies such as the atmosphere in taxi driver or the riots from V for vendetta but once again I disagree, because the film does enough to feel different from all of them. There is so much more I could say to praise this film, but in order to not drag I\u2019ll just leave out some of the less important details."]},

En mi opinion, puede ser visto de muchas maneras, como a la par verlo como un llamado a la sociedad el cual el mensaje sea la tolerancia y el respeto por los demas, el ponerse en los zapatos de la otra persona y comprender que no todos tenemos la misma vida con ventajas o desventajas, como a la vez un simbolo de revelion para otros ya que tambien vivimos en una sociedad donde la moral esta por los suelos cuando uno asiende hacia el poder y es el pueblo mismo quien debe sufrir esa falta de etica por parte del gobierno. Simplemente tiene muchos mensajes sobre la realidad que vivimos hoy en dia y como ya se establecio antes, esto es a manera de entretenimiento solo es una pelicula para ver y reir o llorar un rato de la realidad en la se convirtio el mundo.

The Joker was one of the most recurring villains in them. Yet it wasn't until Batman TAS that Mark Hamill's performance as a voice-actor really brought the Joker to life. For most of my life I felt that the Joker was a perfect if cartoony villain. Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger did amazingly well in the live-action portrayals, but Hamill still did it best. So... my brother and I have been trying to spend a bit more time together as we do not have a lot of family left. We have gone to see a few movies and we both enjoyed comics as kids, so Joker (which I'd heard good things about) was a natural choice. And we were both blown away.

It is a psychological drama set against a fictional city, containing characters with recognisable names all from a comicbook franchise. But it is not a fantasy-filled spandex-fest. Todd Phillips has made this movie in quite a different way than I had imagined possible. It is a story about one unhappy, mentally and emotionally scarred man trying to live in a city that has severe issues. Over the course of the movie, in which these worsen and throughout which Phillips makes the viewer wonder what is real, we follow Arthur Fleck's descent if not into madness than to and beyond the breaking point. The climax of the movie perfectly encapsulates this: if you keep pushing someone, then you will get what you deserve.", "It is a phenomenal artwork, this movie. And Joaquin Phoenix has played his role as Arthur perfectly. Scratch Letho, that was a cartoon character done badly. Phoenix on the other hand has portrayed a human being. A broken man in a **** of a city living in utter misery... You get why what happens, happens. I cannot praise Phoenix enough here as he has made the Joker an actual human being. Something that only occurred in rare flashes throughout the comics, say at the end of The Killing Joke. As a viewer of the movie, you will be touched by this. Hopefully, it will inspire you, or at the least promote empathy.", "The rest of the cast also manages to come across as genuine. The lone mother, the social worker, the asshat office workers...

No, as the slow yet sure descent to madness 'psychological thriller' was a staple in the 70's.  Taxi Driver...A Dog Day's Afternoon...Joker paid a handsome homage to these flicks.

It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Warner\u2019s meddled with Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League because it was too dark. What Todd Phillips does with Joker is infinitely darker than anything Zack Snyder did with DC. That alone is a minor miracle.

He is magnetic in the role; you can\u2019t take your eyes off him. Watching him transform from Arthur Fleck into The Joker is a thing of dark, somber beauty. There is a line in the movie that says \u201cI use to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it\u2019s a comedy.\u201d make no mistake, watching a mentally ill person that is shunned by a society which lacks empathy, slowly deteriorate into a homicidal maniac, is a tragedy.

She manages to capture the mood of the setting and Arthur\u2019s mindset so well. I can\u2019t imagine the movie without this score. The cinematography is great. The colours, the lighting, the close-ups of Joaquin, and in particular, a shot of Joker standing on top of a cop car embracing the chaos he inspired, it\u2019s a thing of beauty. I also liked the addition of a couple of songs from the era it\u2019s set in. Props must be given to the supporting cast, even though they didn\u2019t have too much to do because of the movie\u2019s strong focus on Arthur, but did great with what they had, in particular, Robert Deniro.", "And lastly, the biggest surprise from this movie, is the director, Todd Phillips. When I first heard the news of a Martin Scorsese produced Joker origin movie, the hype within started. Then Joaquin Phoenix got attached to the leading role; the hype picked up the pace. And then Todd Phillips, the director of The Hangover Trilogy attached to direct, the breaks on the hype train were pulled or at least slowed down. I kept the faith that\u2019d be good because if the project had Scorsese and Phoenix interested in it, then it had to be good, so I backed their judgment and subsequently backed Phillips, and I must say, they got it right.

It is one of the best films of 2019, and the hype of its brilliance couldn\u2019t be any more correct. The movie is not about an incel who couldn\u2019t get laid, so he goes loco, like some of the media are portraying it to be.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Well, I FINALLY got around to seeing the controversial and wildly popular film, Joker: the most profitable comic book movie and the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. Now, I intentionally avoided seeing this movie when it came out. Not because I wasn\u2019t interested in seeing it or because I thought I wouldn\u2019t like it, but because of the hype and the controversy. Seemingly, all the reactions were either \u201cIf you like this movie, you\u2019re an incel and a school shooter!\u201d or \u201cIf you don\u2019t like this movie, you\u2019re an SJW and a shill!\u201d and I just hate that black-and-white mentality when it comes to movies, or anything really. I find it really obnoxious. I was sick of hearing about it everywhere so I just stayed away. However, months later, the hype has died down, no one has gotten shot or killed because of this movie and it\u2019s finishing its theatrical run. I paid $5 and saw it at the second-run theatre. What did I think of it? I loved it, but this movie is not perfect. I\u2019ll get the negatives out of the way first since there aren\u2019t a lot of them. I thought the writing was way too unsubtle, obvious and on-the-nose. This film is very clear about what it is saying and it hits you on the head with it, almost like they\u2019re dumbing it down for audiences who aren\u2019t used to watching introspective dramas like this and otherwise wouldn\u2019t if it weren\u2019t based on a famous comic book supervillain. It can make you roll your eyes sometimes. There weren\u2019t too many of those moments for me, but your mileage my vary. Also, there really was no point in setting this in the late 70s/early 80s. I know it\u2019s paying homage to famous Joker stories from the 80s like The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, as well as Martin Scorsese movies from the 70s and 80s like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but you can do an homage without making a period piece. You could set the story in modern-day and it wouldn\u2019t change at all. In fact, some things would make more sense if it were set in a world of social media and mobile phones. You\u2019ll see what I mean if you see the movie. I also think some aspects of this movie would\u2019ve been stronger if they showed rather than told. This movie needed more flashbacks, it would\u2019ve been way more powerful. However, with all that said, I still loved it. I thought it was great. This movie is not fast. It\u2019s not fun. There isn\u2019t much action or comedy. It\u2019s darker and more serious than The Dark Knight. Just know that going in. This is not your typical comic book movie. It\u2019s more A History of Violence than The Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance as the titular character is INCREDIBLE. He\u2019s both sympathetic and scary and adds so many little nuances and special touches to his performance to make it completely his own. This Joker is very much unlike any other Joker we\u2019ve gotten in other movies. It was refreshing, especially after the Suicide Squad fiasco. A lot of the other performers aren\u2019t half bad either, it was cool to see Robert DeNiro in a comic book movie. This movie is beautiful. It\u2019s shot really well and I loved the setdressing. Everything is dirty and grimy and disgusting with garbage everywhere, we\u2019re a long way from the Gotham City of Joel Schumacher\u2019s Batman movies! The score was also haunting and beautiful, with some great music choices for the soundtrack. No Twenty One Pilots here! I also thought this movie was really thematically rich and relevant. It has tons of social commentary about mental health, class, bullying, abuse, trauma, social isolation, gun violence, the media and more. Some might say this film bites off more than it can chew, it does try to juggle a lot of different themes at once, but I think it worked. This movie also connects with the larger mythology of Batman in very clever ways, leaving the door open to possible sequels and spinoffs. I don\u2019t want that, personally, but it\u2019s cool that this movie is also a Batman origin story, in a way. Joker and Batman are still two parts of a whole, even in Joker\u2019s own movie. Overall, Joker is a flawed but great movie.

Stream to Big Screen the best site for movie reviews on the internet! Corny? I think not. Welcome back everyone! This week we were able to view the highly anticipated movie, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Joker is a standalone origin film of many people\u2019s favorite DC Comics villain. The movie is set in the worst of times in Gotham where violence is rampant, civil unrest is prevalent, and the rodent population is no joke. This movie follows Phoenix as the main character, Arthur Fleck. Arthur is a young man longing to fit in and aspiring to be a comedian but is dealing with a bevvy of issues, primarily mental illness. The film leads us through Arthur\u2019s path to becoming the titular Joker.", "While this movie is titled Joker, the theme/takeaway from this movie is no joke. Ultimately, this movie hits way too close to home for American society presently. The bullied, belittled, forgotten person in society deals with mental illness without an appropriate support system, and he has access to a gun. This storyline has become an all too familiar in mainstream media today. For this reason, Joker is a very good conversation piece. But didn\u2019t we come to see a movie based on a comic book? This isn\u2019t what I wanted! Well, this is important to know. DON\u2019T go into this movie expecting a comic book like story or a connection to the comics, other than the name.", "With that said, Warner Bros. couldn\u2019t have found a better or more experienced lead actor than Phoenix. Phoenix definitely has practice acting like a power seeking maniac begging to be remembered. I\u2019m looking at you Commodus! From the beginning to the end, Phoenix takes us through every single range of emotion Arthur experiences. It truly is quite impressive. Phoenix\u2019s acting and the movie provide a great feeling of anxiety, not necessarily suspense, throughout. Unfortunately, the director either held Phoenix back or chose to feature too many early movie boring set up scenes. When Phoenix acts his craziest, the movie is epic but there is just far too little of it to get over the boring parts. In a way, I felt deceived by the intense commercials and trailers. We\u2019ve been waiting for nearly a year to see this movie. Yes, the movie provides a few intense moments but far too few. And, far too little of Zazie Beetz! Honestly, they could\u2019ve interchanged her with any actress to do the same thing. Nevertheless, her presence was still welcomed.", "And then when I wasn\u2019t bored, I was predicting exactly what was supposed to be a surprise or twist in the movie. I\u2019m not sure if it was the scene selection or a purposeful directorial decision, but at times the same scenes just didn\u2019t make sense when I was watching them. Eventually, my suspicions were confirmed and I just said ,\u201dduh!\u201d", "All of that said, Joker delivers in some aspects (I didn\u2019t even mention the great score in the movie) but ultimately will let you down. Joaquin does a good job as the Joker, but he\u2019s never going to be regarded like a Heath Ledger once the dust settles. Try to check this movie out at a matinee time, if your a big Joker/DC fan. Everyone else, you may be disappointed in a matinee price but for a reasonable price it\u2019s worth it or an early streaming rental.", "The Stream: Takes unbelievably long to get moving and then supremely predictable.", "The Big Screen: Joaquin delivers an uneven performance but worth watching.", "The Final Bill: Joker is an overhyped film that will create some conversations about mental health issues in society.", "-S2S: Movie Review"]},

The concept is great, the feel of falling into mad descent, the uncontrollable laugh, the play on Thomas Wayne and Joker, these are all done phenomenally(and a few others I can't spoil). I can't help but to feel thought, that this movie could have been and should have been a 9 or even 10. It's got all the right pieces to the puzzle and with a more thorough execution would be right there. I think making this movie 3 hours long, showing a little more of his descent into madness, and really capitalizing on the final few scenes and not leaving you with the ending that it did really would have put this to number 1 for me but above all it's still a really good film.

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Abstract:", "The Joker is a love letter to Scorsese, a call back to favorite art films with a universally recognized man at its center. Truthfully it hammers away at its audience that society treats the mentally ill, and anyone who is remotely different, terribly. If you were unaware of this fact and want to feel \u201cartsy\u201d, this film is for you. Otherwise it\u2019s a hard pass. Review:", "A foreword, my personal bias may have tainted this review as it was impossible to escape the controversy leading up to this film. It was also unavoidable to ignore the way the movie bragged about copying other \u201cart films\u201d.", "Where to begin with the Joker. This film is beautifully shot, and thoughtfully tries to recreate the classic aesthetic of films like Taxi Driver or the King of Comedy. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully throws his all physically and emotionally into the ill mind of Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Sadly for all that the film tries to replicate, it remains just that; a replication. It lacks the true heart behind art films, and insists upon itself that it truly is a work of art. Let\u2019s break down the two key elements the movie tries to convey. Mental Illness: While the movie tries to paint the image that Arthur is mentally ill, being diagnosed with a \u201cvague disorder\u201d; by the movie\u2019s end it undoes the effort it puts in. We see Arthur hallucinate about being on TV or in a relationship with his neighbor, but these are short lived; he\u2019s not delusional he\u2019s daydreaming.  And the emotion Phoenix puts into these realizations show us that he knows what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. Next let\u2019s examine his nervous tick, his uncanny laughter. Ticks are not a mental illness, everyone has small ticks; this one is just unnerving. But rolling with this being a \u201csign of mental illness\u201d is still hard to swallow, the execution and timing are off. His laughter is neither convenient for the plot, nor random enough to be a consistent piece of his character. The only consistency with his laughter is to show that society is mean. A great segue into the next theme:", "Cruel Society: It should be no shock to anyone that society and mobs can be cruel. However the citizens of Gotham seem to be an extra special brand of terrible. They go out of their way to not only berate and belittle Arthur, but to physically attack and assault him. In a movie based \u201cin reality\u201d I could not suspend belief long enough to imagine three Wayne Enterprise employees breaking into song together to attack a stranger. That brings us to the vengeance of Thomas Wayne. Now I was keen to see this take on Wayne. It makes sense for a man in his position to be a villain to Arthur. I could understand him being cruel, or two-faced; showing vile contempt for the man claiming to be his bastard son, while smiling and feigning charity while on camera. But this isn\u2019t the case. Thomas Wayne is as cruel on camera as he is to Aruthur\u2019s face. Is this really supposed to be the man championed as a Pillar of Gotham? Needless to say these two themes coalesce into Joker\u2019s main point: If you are mentally ill, or different, or a minority, or look weird, society will treat you horribly. This should not be profound, nor does it need to be lauded. Nevertheless it spends 2 hours and 2 minutes elaborating on this until you feel sick. Actually to the film\u2019s credit it does that quite well; it doesn\u2019t forgive or excuse Arthur for his eventual crimes and murders. By the end you are horrified."]},

There is not a moment of this movie where I feel happy. It is very consistent with it's tone and the atmosphere is so gritty. The constant sirens, the trash on the streets, the graffiti on the subway, all of it contributes to a hopeless feeling. Joaquin Pheonix gives the best acting performance of his career, which is saying a lot. His laugh is one of the best Joker laughs, only beaten by Heath Ledger. His improvisation is on point and always feels consistent. When he commits a crime, he always gives you the feeling that deep down, he enjoys it. The cinematography is so incredible and the dark colour palette looks like its ripped out of the 80's.", "Joker is a great movie, but like all great movies, it is flawed. Rupert Pupkin from The King Of Comedy(1983) is very clearly an influence on this movie. And by influence, I mean they ripped his character nearly completely off. An unreliable narrator that tries his best to become a comedian and become famous. He fails and this, among other things, leads to him commiting a terrible crime. The personalities are different, but the storylines are quite similar. Todd Philips and Scott Silver also take influence from Taxi Driver(1979), another Scorcese film. Joker has the same obsession with guns and commits the same crime. Just because it isn't original doesn't mean it's bad, but it does have another issue. Joker's atmosphere can be a bit repetitive.

Now this isn't to relate to this film's protagonist or sound like an edge lord but these marvel films are a \"roller coaster ride\" as Martin Scorsese describes them.

It surely isn't 100% relatable, as of course what the joker does in this film is immoral and unethical in every way, cant just go about killing people the way he did in this film. But, it is very realistic, its sad, its pessimistic and it shines a light on the reality that some mentally ill patients probably experience on a day to day basis. It also captures the reality of wealthy capitalists causing divisions between the rich and the poor in America (only in America, NOT IN THE UK) and other countries like Brazil. For instance, the game Max Payne 3 captures this pessimism in a similar way except Max is a hero rather than the anti-hero that is the Joker. This division of rich and poor is clear when you have to pay for healthcare in America and the fact that they advertise all sorts of health products there and make falsified claims about it goes to show on this division. Then again this isn't to get political, I don't agree with the idea of sparking a revolution because killing people isn't a good thing but this is a film and entertainment is of course for escapism. Understanding the Joker's mind and what he goes through was what we escaped into with this film and because of how realistic it is and emotional at times, it makes this film a master piece.", "Apparently Scorsese films influenced this film and I can 100% agree with this since I love his films.

It tells the chilling story of the vulnerable Arthur Fleck's transition to becoming the Joker. The score and cinematography help to improve the story,. The best part of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix, who absolutely carries this movie with his performances. My main problem with this movie is that it isn't much of a \"Joker\" movie; it's almost 90% an Arthur Fleck movie. In addition, I wasn't a fan of the Joker character itself. There's no way he could keep up in the criminal underworld."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Overhyped in the name of getting quotes like \"there is the world before Joker and there is the world after Joked\" spread all over the internet for reviewer clout. This movie is far from disappointing, but ANYTHING would have been after all the hype this film got (supposed standing ovations at festivals and winning an award a bunch of best picture winners have won previously).", "Now, about the actual movie In a lot of ways, its Taxi Driver with a DC skin. It has the same tone and a lot of the same themes, but plot beats and base character motivations are drastically different. What you've heard about Phoenix's performance is all true, but I also loved the sometimes demented, sometimes classic style of cinematography and how the score would switch back and forth between sounding like what the character's perceived feelings on the events/situations were in a scene and what a sane person's perceptions of that same scene would be (triumphant vs. horrific).", "In addition to Jaoquin's performance, I thought that the few brief moments the supporting cast were given to play in were acted flawlessly as well. Zazzy Beats, Bryan Tyree Henry, and Deniro all had a brief moment to shine and they all took full advantage. I only have two real complaints about the film. First, I thought almost all additional tie-ins to the DC universe were the weakest parts of the movie. One with pearls felt particularly shoehorned in. And second, I wish the film had cut to black on the last line of dialogue Phoenix delivered. It would have been just a bit more effective than the more drawn out ending we got, I think, because that last line has some real punch to it. Maybe it would have felt cheesy. Lmk. Not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed it and will definitely see it again."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["Joker may initially scan as a pastiche of Scorsese's neo-noir \"existential hero\" style, but further watching reveals a film that isn't a loving forgery as much as it breathes new life into this style of filmmaking, picking up the torch where the original director left off. Like \"Taxi Driver\", it brings with it an ability to pull on every uncomfortable string of our tense social ball-of-yarn, slowly unraveling a complex web of institutions geared steering us away from the yearning emptiness of our late-stage capitalist lives, and like \"The King of Comedy\", gives a powerful and haunted glimpse into the inner worlds of the unstable and self-absorbed. Yet, it doesn't just sandwich concepts from other films, but brings with it a variety of new tools that didn't exist in that era of filmmaking, such as the ability to show some sympathy to these malignant figures and see that their struggle is ours, and warns us all of the potential danger of leaving loose threads frayed for too long."]},

{"content": [" "], "expanded_content": ["This film gave me one of the most unique cinematic experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Phoenix\u2019s performance was one of the best performances I could recall ever seeing after leaving the theatre, better than just the best performance of 2019. I was in disbelief that the person I was watching on the screen was Joaquin Phoenix - from start to finish he was unrecognizably dedicated to playing the role and very highly emotionally provocative for the audience. The cinematography was phenomenally uncomfortable, the score was hauntingly brilliant, the supporting cast were well selected, and the movie pacing was uniquely captivating. This was also the best Gotham city setting to me so far. The film setting drew me in and made me feel filthy. The metaphors and the score from the film were particularly powerful. There is ever present audience gripping tension starting from the first minute of the film until the end. You could really feel the emotional involvement of the audience in the theatre. The final 45 minutes of this film are truly some of the best cinema ever produced. This was not simply a shut-your-brain-off for 2 hours entertainment movie - more so a movie of great importance that\u2019s thought provoking throughout and will absolutely move the viewer to self reflect."]},
